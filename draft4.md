title: Three Essays on Urban Economics
author: Osman Keshawarz
toc: true
bibliography: prospectus.bib
abstract: "This prospectus proposes three questions in the field of urban political economy. The first is a theoretical question on the relationship between urban growth, wages, and rents, based on classical political economy treatments of the land question. The second is a historical-discriptive question that applies the theoretical insights of the first chapter to the recent burst of growth and subsequent crisis of housing in San Francisco. The final question is on the impacts of rent control laws in the United States."

# Introduction: Centering Space in Political Economy

# What do Landlords Do? The Political Economy of Urban Growth and Distribution

>Rents don't increase because buildings get better, buildings get better because rents increase

## Abstract

>This chapter is about the spatial impacts of urban growth. In
particular, it investigates the way that urban economies of scale and
agglomeration affect the distribution of wages, profits, and rents-- who
gains when cities grow? How does growth affect, and get affected by, urban
density? Who decides? Since this essay, in essence, seeks
to spatialize urban growth, it relies heavily on the classical political
economy and radical geography traditions surrounding land rents, scale,
and the production of space. The essay is divided into two parts;
the first is a survey of the history of economic thought surrounding land,
rent, and urban structure. The second is a formal presentation, seeking to
show the conditions under which increases in productivity are captured by
different sections of an urban economy.

### The Evolution of Economic Thought on Housing and Rents

Ricardo, Marx, Keynes), Critical Geography (Lefebvre, Harvey, (Neil) Smith,
Aalbers), Neoclassical Urban Economics (Brueckner, Glaeser, Moretti, Florida)*


# On the Housing Question in San Francisco

## Abstract

>This chapter applies the theoretical insights from the previous chapter
into a historical-descriptive account of the development of wages and
rents in the San Francisco Bay Area.

# Rent Control Revisited: Is it Good, Actually? 

## Abstract

>This essay is a contribution to the empirical literature on rent control.
Despite re-invigorated demands for rent control policies across the
nation, the consensus of the economics discipline has remained solidly
against the measure. How severe are the deleterious effects of rent
control on housing supply, rents, and neighborhood composition? Does it
really achieve the desired end of neighborhood stabilization, or does it
merely increase the rate of gentrification and rent growth? This essay
addresses the difficulty of well-identified empirical work on housing in
general, and estimates the impacts of municipal rent control policies on
rents, tenure length, neighborhood amenity access, the rate of new housing
construction, and the supply of rental housing.
