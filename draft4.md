# Introduction: Centering Space in Political Economy

# What do Landlords Do? The Political Economy of Urban Growth and Distribution

## Abstract

>This chapter is about the spatial impacts of urban growth. In
particular, it investigates the way that urban economies of scale and
agglomeration affect the distribution of wages, profits, and rents-- who
gains when cities grow? How does growth affect, and get affected by, urban
density? Who decides? Since this essay, in essence, seeks
to spatialize urban growth, it relies heavily on the classical political
economy and radical geography traditions surrounding land rents, scale,
and the production of space. The essay is divided into two parts;
the first is a survey of the history of economic thought surrounding land,
rent, and urban structure. The second is a formal presentation, seeking to
show the conditions under which increases in productivity are captured by
different sections of an urban economy.

# Rent Control Revisited: Is it Good, Actually? 

## Abstract

>This essay is a contribution to the empirical literature on rent control. Despite re-invigorated demands for rent control policies across the nation, the consensus of the economics discipline has remained solidly against the measure. How severe are the deleterious effects of rent control on housing supply, rents, and neighborhood composition? Does it really achieve the desired end of neighborhood stabilization, or does it merely increase the rate of gentrification and rent growth? This essay addresses the difficulty of well-identified empirical work on housing in general, and estimates the impacts of municipal rent control policies on rents, tenure length, neighborhood amenity access, the rate of new housing construction, and the supply of rental housing.
