title: Three Essays on Urban Economics
author: Osman Keshawarz
toc: true
bibliography: prospectus.bib
abstract: "This prospectus proposes three questions in the field of urban political economy. The first is a theoretical question on the relationship between urban growth, wages, and rents, based on classical political economy treatments of the land question. The second is a historical-discriptive question that applies the theoretical insights of the first chapter to the recent burst of growth and subsequent crisis of housing in San Francisco. The final question is on the impacts of rent control laws in the United States."

# Rent Control Revisited: Is it Good, Actually? 

## Abstract

>This essay is a contribution to the empirical literature on rent control.
Despite re-invigorated demands for rent control policies across the
nation, the consensus of the economics discipline has remained solidly
against the measure. How severe are the deleterious effects of rent
control on housing supply, rents, and neighborhood composition? Does it
really achieve the desired end of neighborhood stabilization, or does it
merely increase the rate of gentrification and rent growth? This essay
addresses the difficulty of well-identified empirical work on housing in
general, and estimates the impacts of municipal rent control policies on
rents, tenure length, neighborhood amenity access, the rate of new housing
construction, and the supply of rental housing.
