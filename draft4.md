title: Three Essays on Urban Economics
author: Osman Keshawarz
toc: true
bibliography: prospectus.bib
abstract: "This prospectus proposes three questions in the field of urban political economy. The first is a theoretical question on the relationship between urban growth, wages, and rents, based on classical political economy treatments of the land question. The second is a historical-discriptive question that applies the theoretical insights of the first chapter to the recent burst of growth and subsequent crisis of housing in San Francisco. The final question is on the impacts of rent control laws in the United States."

# Introduction: Centering Space in Political Economy

The discipline of Economics, at long last, has been going through
something of a "spatial turn" in recent years. It has become more and more
apparent that heterogeneity and divergence across geographic scales are
strikingly persistent [@ganong2017; @chetty2014], and that these
differences across space require more sophisticated explanations than
factor endowments and convergent-growth models. 

Spatiality, in the form of land and land rents, had been central to
economic thought since Adam Smith; 

# What do Landlords Do? The Political Economy of Urban Growth and Distribution

> Rents don't increase because buildings get better, buildings get better because rents increase

## Abstract

> This chapter is about the spatial impacts of urban growth. In
> particular, it investigates the way that urban economies of scale and
> agglomeration affect the distribution of wages, profits, and rents-- who
> gains when cities grow? How does growth affect, and get affected by, urban
> density? Who decides? Since this essay, in essence, seeks
> to spatialize urban growth, it relies heavily on the classical political
> economy and radical geography traditions surrounding land rents, scale,
> and the production of space. The essay is divided into two parts;
> the first is a survey of the history of economic thought surrounding land,
> rent, and urban structure. The second is a formal presentation, seeking to
> show the conditions under which increases in productivity are captured by
> different sections of an urban economy. 

## Introduction

### The Evolution of Economic Thought on Housing and Rents

_three major strands of literature here: Classical political economy (Smith,
Ricardo, Marx, George, Keynes), Critical Geography (Lefebvre, Harvey, (Neil) Smith,
Aalbers), Neoclassical Urban Economics (Brueckner, Glaeser, Moretti, Florida)_

# Rent Control Revisited: Is it Good, Actually?

## Abstract

> This essay is a contribution to the empirical literature on rent control.
> Despite re-invigorated demands for rent control policies across the
> nation, the consensus of the economics discipline has remained solidly
> against the measure. How severe are the deleterious effects of rent
> control on housing supply, rents, and neighborhood composition? Does it
> really achieve the desired end of neighborhood stabilization, or does it
> merely increase the rate of gentrification and rent growth? This essay
> addresses the difficulty of well-identified empirical work on housing in
> general, and estimates the impacts of municipal rent control policies on
> rents, tenure length, neighborhood amenity access, the rate of new housing
> construction, and the supply of rental housing.
