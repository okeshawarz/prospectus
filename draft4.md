# Rent Control Revisited: Is it Good, Actually? 

## Abstract

>This essay is a contribution to the empirical literature on rent control. Despite re-invigorated demands for rent control policies across the nation, the consensus of the economics discipline has remained solidly against the measure. How severe are the deleterious effects of rent control on housing supply, rents, and neighborhood composition? Does it really achieve the desired end of neighborhood stabilization, or does it merely increase the rate of gentrification and rent growth? This essay addresses the difficulty of well-identified empirical work on housing in general, and estimates the impacts of municipal rent control policies on rents, tenure length, neighborhood amenity access, the rate of new housing construction, and the supply of rental housing.
