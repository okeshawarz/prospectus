<p>Brenner places critical urban theory within the canon of the Western Marxist tradition. He sums up the project neatly in Marcuse&#8217;s words: it is concerned with &#8220;the historical alternatives which haunt the established society as subversive tendencies and forces.&#8221; In other words, it seeks to establish a critique of the existing ideological hegemony, from the entry-point which states that any such existing hegemony is not total but a historically-specific product of already-existing social relations. For Brenner, there are four key elements of critical theory: 1) Critical theory is theory; it seeks to generate only abstract conceptions of the world <em>as it is</em>, as separate from practice and social movements (it is primarily this that I find the most questionable out of Frankfurt School thought. 2) It is reflexive; it considers its own viewpoint as existing within, and inseperable from, the existing social totality (i.e., modern capitalism). 3) The critique of instrumental reason; the rejection of the idea of a technocratic vision of (social) science in favor of a view that regards normative questions as inseparable from theory. And 4) an emphasis on the disjuncture between the actual and the possible; in addition to the critique of the existing social order, an analysis in which opposition to that order may crack and take root.</p>
<p>What then is the role for critical <em>urban</em> theory? At first blush, if we take the urban form (Brenner&#8217;s post-Fordist, post-Keynesian city) as integral to the functioning of modern capitalism, then critical theory must by definition deal with questions of urban ideology and processes. Rather than the sterile, equilibriation approach of economic geography, there is space hear to tear apart the inner workings of the capitalist urban process to examine an &#8220;&#8216;urban fabric,&#8217; composed of diverse types of investment patterns, settlement spaces, land use matrices, and infrastructural networks&#8230;&#8221; Indeed, the urban form is fundamental to the operation of modern capitalism, the literal material existence of capital accumulation, production, and re-production.</p>
<p>Castells places urban theory into a more classical Marxist framework. In fact, it is somewhat surprising how singularly class-focus it appears at first glance; the first several chapters are designed to build an argument that places specifically class politics at the center of the urban process. He links the historical development of cities from large towns via the &#8220;social production of spatial forms;&#8221; In every case, including the modern metropolises of advanced capitalism, the urban form is dictated by the specific formations of production and distribution that require particular but constantly-evolving social and technological orientations in space. As the development of capitalism continues (in Western cities), industry becomes increasingly reliant on command-and-control functions that can only be supplied by cities of increasing density and reach. This, I think is one of the key insights regarding the development of cities in late capitalism: the co-development of monopolistic concentration of physical capital and the organization requirements of very large units lead to both spatial decentralization (of specific production sites) and increasing regional interdependence (i.e.&#160;a growing regional division of labor). In the American context, this leads to sprawling megalopolises, where large cities exhibit dominance over the tiny empire of cities in their near-abroad.</p>
<p>Turning to the developing world, he develops a dependency view of urbanization in colonized and semi-colonized countries, in which the social structure of peripheral cities is structured by the economic and social dominance of cities in the third world; the need for a reserve army of labor to feed a specifically western-oriented process of industrialization results in both a collapse of rural society and the deformation of the urban social economy (in the sense of the ability to provide for social reproduction), leading to what on the surface seems like &#8220;over-urbanization.&#8221; In this context, the development literature surrounding &#8220;urban bias&#8221; can be seen in a new light; rather than a simple matter of corruption or industrial policy, the urban bias can be seen as the best of bad options to cope with the contradictions imposed by dependent urban industrialization.</p>
<p>The linchpin of Castells&#8217; argument is that we must take the urban as the historically specific spatial formation by which consumption and production under capitalism are structured; but further than that, space itself (and thus the spatial distribution of each element of the social structure) is produced by the same process of capitalism. Therefore, we can only treat space under capitalism as any of the other things that define the material reality of human existence&#8211; objects of production and consumption. And, as such, the proper analysis of the structure and form of cities is in the domain of the analysis of urban politics; class struggle.</p>
