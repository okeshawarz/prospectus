<h1 id="marxist-political-economy-contd-class-monopoly-rents">Marxist Political Economy, cont&#8217;d: Class Monopoly Rents</h1>
<p>Harvey takes aim at the classical (and neo-classical) notion of rent; namely, that rent is a natural rationing mechanism by which a scarce resource (i.e., land) is &#8220;allocated to its most productive uses.&#8221; He first peels back the curtain on the factor payments explanation, noting that rent is paid not to a factor of production, but a <em>person</em>&#8211; in other words, an <em>owner.</em> And, like any other institution of capitalism, the institution of property ownership requires a vast and totalizing social apparatus (I include &#8220;social&#8221; here, as I think Harvey does, to also mean both <em>built</em> and <em>created</em> elements of social life). Land is ultimately limited, it is true, but rent is owed not merely on the land but on the improvements and structures built upon it; the built environment itself is produced, but then once produced, becomes indistinguishable from the &#8220;natural&#8221; environment. Yet the scarcity of the built environment is <em>produced</em>, and is in some sense an artificial scarcity&#8211; and the built environment is itself an input into the production process (either directly, as means of production, or indirectly as means of social reproduction). Then, to whom are rents paid, and for what reason?</p>
<p>Harvey develops the notion of class-monopoly rent (the most chilling part of which is the idea that a scholar of urban political economy must understand the transformation problem in order to fully theorize) to explain the role of class power in the allocation of land rents. Class-monopoly rents arise when there exists a class of (non-produced) resource owners that are empowered (by private property relations) to act as a class in order to &#8220;&#8230;achieve some minimum rate of return.&#8221; There are two major (in my view) questions to be answered here: 1) from where does this class power arise, and 2) in what sense can landlords be said to act &#8220;as a class&#8221;? It is clear that landlords and tenants have opposite class interests; by virtue of ownership, the landlord (as a class) can adjust the depreciation of the housing stock (or its transformation into money-capital) until scarcity drives up rents. In wealthier neighborhoods, the capture of class-monopoly rents is done by a class of speculator-developers, hold and develop land in the service of wealthy groups seeking returns. The abilities of this class to generate such returns is dependent, according to Harvey, on its capture of the local mechanisms of state control. It is less clear to me, however, that this class operates <em>as a class,</em> rather than as an extension of the capitalist class into the land market. Finally, these various elements of the social rent relationship organize themselves into a hierarchy: tenants at the bottom, then landlords, with financial institutions backed by the state at the top. It seems to me that within this framework, landlords operate as a dependent class to financial capitalists and their agents&#8211; during real estate crises, it is not the banks that are ruined, but the landlords themselves (along with their tenants, of course).</p>
<p>Harvey applies this framework to the city of Baltimore. The inner city is dominated by relations of the first type, in which landlords manage an impressive rate of return despite high rates of vacancy and the onrush of deindustrialization (though Harvey does not mention this latter point). The white areas are characterized largely by community-financed home-ownership, with little in the way of the possibility of class-monopoly rents. The black residential areas created monopoly rents by virtue of the white supremacist power structure, which enforced a scarcity of both land and housing credit on black families who wished to own homes or rent outside of the city core. I have two comments to make here: first is the rather obvious note that the class power of <em>residents</em> in white areas is directly linked to the accessibility of homes for ownership, rather than rental. And the second, related point is that there are echoes of a certain type of race-blindness peculiar to the Marxian tradition&#8211; though &#8220;discrimination&#8221; is mentioned as the reason for the discrepancy in housing access, there is little detail on how this discrepancy came to be enforced. Presumably, it was politically enforced by the capitalist power structure with the abettance of the white homeowning class (of course, this comes up in later Harvey).</p>
<p>What does this mean for urban structure? Harvey likens urban development to a series of &#8220;islands in which class monopolies produce absolute scarcities.&#8221; Here he comes tantalizingly close to calling the construction of discrete man-made absolute spaces as &#8220;the production of space as a commodity.&#8221; <em>Contra</em> the Chicago and Neoclassical Schools&#8217; view of urban development as an ecological, equilibrium process, for Harvey the production of space is quite literally a field of battle on which landlords and speculators utilize the machinery of the state to extract a greater division of the social structure through class-monopoly rents.</p>
