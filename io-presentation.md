# Introduction 

## Why am I Doing This? The Big Questions

>...but despite the fact that house-price inflation fueled the crisis and land, as a non-reproducible asset, is the prime candidate for house-price inflation through ground-rent capitalization, the review does not even mention what Marx considered the third major class of modern capitalism, landlords, and their distinct source of revenue, ground rent (Dymski 2016)

## My General Approach

There are likely very many factors driving regional and intra-regional divergence in the United States. In this research, I'm choosing real estate as my entry point for a number of reasons. 

1. It is the literal physical manifestation of the processes of production and re-production under capitalism

2. It is, in my opinion, relatively under-theorized in the economics literature, for reasons which I will touch on below

3. It has a relatively direct and straightforward bearing on the "big questions" that I am interested in answering-- namely questions of inequality, politics, and power. 

4. It also has relatively direct and straightforward relevance to questions of policy at national, local, and state levels.

In other words, my goal is to shed some light on the reification of power relations under capitalism as exercised through land and property markets. So I'm going to talk largely about the distributional role that landed property plays in urban capitalism. Importantly, I am *not* going to say very much about the intergenerational effects of inherited wealth, at least not yet. I want to generate a theoretical account of the role that real estate plays in the structuring of the urban capitalist economy.

## The Regulation View

>We can observe that some of the largest U.S. cities with both restrictive zoning rules and desirable public goods tended to have persistently high housing prices relative to the cost of construction [@gyourko2013].

## The Classical View

>This simple model only works because the nature of urban land as an economic good is erased from the analysis. The problem is of course obvious: urban land can't obey the laws of supply and demand because it is fixed in supply. An increase in demand can only lead to a jump in the prices of land. Thus the old economic problem of land rent refuses to go away. A substantive and policy-relevant economics of urban space has to engage with the ways in which determinations are made over the disposition of this socially generated surplus [@sclar2018].
