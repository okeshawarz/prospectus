# Introduction 

## Why am I Doing This? The Big Questions

## My General Approach

There are likely very many factors driving regional and intra-regional divergence in the United States. In this research, I'm choosing real estate as my entry point for a number of reasons. 

1. It is the literal physical manifestation of the processes of production and re-production under capitalism

2. It is, in my opinion, relatively under-theorized in the economics literature, for reasons which I will touch on below

3. It has a relatively direct and straightforward bearing on the "big questions" that I am interested in answering-- namely questions of inequality, politics, and power. 

4. It also has relatively direct and straightforward relevance to questions of policy at national, local, and state levels.

In other words, my goal is to shed some light on the reification of power relations under capitalism as exercised through land and property markets. So I'm going to talk largely about the distributional role that landed property plays in urban capitalism. Importantly, I am *not* going to say very much about the intergenerational effects of inherited wealth, at least not yet. I want to generate a theoretical account of the role that real estate plays in the structuring of the urban capitalist economy.
