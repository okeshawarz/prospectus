# Land and Property

![Labor share vs. Housing and Non-Housing Capital Share](images/labshare-housing.png)

* from Rognlie (2015), calculated from Piketty & Zucman (2014). A note: income share going to housing also includes imputed rents to owner-occupied housing. It may be the case that including this on the labor side equalizes the outcome.

# The Regulation View (1) 

# Detangling Land, Housing, and Rent

* Land prices included in housing costs for macroeconomic statistics $\rightarrow$ how to decompose? 

* Land prices drive 87% of housing prices in the United States (Knoll et. al 2014) $\rightarrow$ how does this square with Glaeser et. al? (i.e., prices in excess of construction costs being driven by land values)

* Consider an increase in land value; total surplus value has not increased, but owner of land can command higher rents, and therefore a higher percentage of the social surplus $\rightarrow$ Ricardian outcome

	* The distinction between *wealth* aggregates and *productive capital* aggregates are not evident in national accounts! (Stiglitz 2015)

# The Disappearance of Land from the Production Function

# Why is Land Not Capital? Why Does It Matter?

* Land (as applied to real estate) is non-produced, non-reproducible, and non-depreciable $\rightarrow$ land values *appreciate*, rather than depreciate

# Contradictions of the Housing Commodity

# Rent Dynamics in a Revived Classical Context


# The Henry George Hypothesis

* Once un-owned land is occupied, economic rent becomes determined by *locational* advantage (i.e., the "unearned increment")

* Locational advantage in the urban context derives from access to: global networks, infrastructure, human capital

* As productivity increases, the ability of landlords to capture greater share of the surplus increases

	* Some questions: This does not quite seem to be the case after GFC-- small landlords were wiped out just as badly as large landlords
