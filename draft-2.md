# Introduction

# What do Landlords do? Real Estate, Growth, and Distribution

## Abstract

The labor share of the national income has decreased in the past 40 years as the capital share has grown, in contravention of Kaldor's stylized facts of growth. Further decompositions of the capital share of income found that, unexpectedly, the gains in capital's share of income have come from an increased flow of income to *housing*, rather than corporate and industrial capital [@rognlie2015]. I hypothesize that this macroeconomic movement in the labor share is driven by a regional change in the relationship between capital, labor, and land. I posit that that real-estate capitalists are able to take advantage of the urban and regional geography of rents to capture a greater share of income. I further propose that this ability is driven by agglomeration effects in cities, leading to a regional stagnation equilibrium where disproportionate growth in land rents chokes off growth in urban regions. 

## Research Questions

**How much of increases in regional income is captured by landlords? What are the conditions governing the distribution between wages and rents?**

[a note: this is similar, but related to this question:]

**Is the increase in the share of income devoted to rent constricting urban growth?**

**Are the gains from increased productivity in urban regions being captured more and more by landlords?**

## Introduction

Regional inequality has become a topic of considerable importance since the Great Financial Crisis. Much of the recent literature in labor and urban economics has been on the subject of "superstar cities;" the phenomenon where the largest cities undergo rapid growth in income and employment, while smaller ones stagnate and decline.

A major focus of the theoretical and empirical literature has been on the skill-sorting of cities, with skill-biased technical change driving in-migration of skilled labor and rising costs driving out-migration of lower-skilled workers into depressed suburbs and smaller cities. 

The rise of superstar cities has led to a consequent crisis of housing in *all* cities of the United States, with increases in homelessness and declines in homeownership and affordability across-the-board, but especially in urban centers of the most productive city-regions. 

Much of the recent literature on the relationship between housing and regional growth focuses on the elasticity of the housing supply with respect to housing regulations, particularly zoning. Though the theoretical result is relatively straightforward (tight housing regulations cause high land rents, leading to skill sorting), empirical support for this conclusion has been somewhat ambiguous. Relaxation of the political constraints on zoning may [@hsieh2019] or may not [@freemark2019] have led to a decrease in the cost of housing. 

In this essay, I propose an alternate explanation based on theories of rent and class in the tradition of classical political economy. The mechanism of crucial importance, in this case, is the division of the regional product into payments of wages, profits, and rents, with the distribution between the three a question of political and social struggle over the division of the regional product. 

In the classical view, landlords command a monopoly over a particular location, conveyed to them via the social relation of private ownership. This allows them to demand rents^[in this case, also in the neo-classical sense of payments in excess of what is required to bring a factor into production] by virtue of a naturally-existing short-side power. The returns to land ownership (or, equivalently, the power to demand a particular level of rent) is almost wholly externally derived. *My proposition here is that in the presence of powerful network or agglomeration effects, the ability of landlords to extract rents is enhanced.*

As Harvey notes, the class of landlords performs a dual, contradictory function;

1) Facilitating competition by absorbing any above-average profits,

2) Choking off investment by reducing the surplus value available to invest, either directly through land rents on commercial real estate, or indirectly through residential real estate 
which may put further upward pressure on wage demands.

## Abstract

## Research Questions

1. **Who benefited from the relaxation of rent control regulations in a number of American cities during the period 1965-1995? What impact did this have on growth and distribution (between wages, profits, and rents)? The supply of housing?**

2. **Who would benefit from a current imposition of rent control in urban rental markets?**
