# Introduction

# What do Landlords do? Real Estate, Growth, and Distribution

## Abstract

The labor share of the national income has decreased in the past 40 years as the capital share has grown, in contravention of Kaldor's stylized facts of growth. Further decompositions of the capital share of income found that, unexpectedly, the gains in capital's share of income have come from an increased flow of income to *housing*, rather than corporate and industrial capital [@rognlie2015]. I hypothesize that this macroeconomic movement in the labor share is driven by a regional change in the relationship between capital, labor, and land. I posit that that real-estate capitalists are able to take advantage of the urban and regional geography of rents to capture a greater share of income. I further propose that this ability is driven by agglomeration effects in cities, leading to a regional stagnation equilibrium where disproportionate growth in land rents chokes off growth in urban regions. 

## Research Questions

**How much of increases in regional income is captured by landlords? What are the conditions governing the distribution between wages and rents?**

[a note: this is similar, but related to this question:]

**Is the increase in the share of income devoted to rent constricting urban growth?**

**Are the gains from increased productivity in urban regions being captured more and more by landlords?**

## Introduction

### Background

Regional inequality has become a topic of considerable importance since the Great Financial Crisis. Much of the recent literature in labor and urban economics has been on the subject of "superstar cities;" the phenomenon where the largest cities undergo rapid growth in income and employment, while smaller ones stagnate and decline.

A major focus of the theoretical and empirical literature has been on the skill-sorting of cities, with skill-biased technical change driving in-migration of skilled labor and rising costs driving out-migration of lower-skilled workers into depressed suburbs and smaller cities. 

The rise of superstar cities has led to a consequent crisis of housing in *all* cities of the United States, with increases in homelessness and declines in homeownership and affordability across-the-board, but especially in urban centers of the most productive city-regions. 

Much of the recent literature on the relationship between housing and regional growth focuses on the elasticity of the housing supply with respect to housing regulations, particularly zoning. Though the theoretical result is relatively straightforward (tight housing regulations cause high land rents, leading to skill sorting), empirical support for this conclusion has been somewhat ambiguous. Relaxation of the political constraints on zoning may [@hsieh2019] or may not [@freemark2019] have led to a decrease in the cost of housing. 

In this essay, I propose an alternate explanation based on theories of rent and class in the tradition of classical political economy. The mechanism of crucial importance, in this case, is the division of the regional product into payments of wages, profits, and rents, with the distribution between the three a question of political and social struggle over the division of the regional product. 

In the classical view, landlords command a monopoly over a particular location, conveyed to them via the social relation of private ownership. This allows them to demand rents^[in this case, also in the neo-classical sense of payments in excess of what is required to bring a factor into production] by virtue of a naturally-existing short-side power. The returns to land ownership (or, equivalently, the power to demand a particular level of rent) is almost wholly externally derived. *My proposition here is that in the presence of powerful network or agglomeration effects, the ability of landlords to extract rents is enhanced.*

As Harvey notes, the class of landlords performs a dual, contradictory function;

1) Facilitating competition by absorbing any above-average profits,

2) Choking off investment by reducing the surplus value available to invest, either directly through land rents on commercial real estate, or indirectly through residential real estate 
which may put further upward pressure on wage demands. 

### Description of Approach

My contribution to the literature is to analyze the role of landed property through the lens of distributive conflict. To be certain, I do not deny the role of supply constraints in limiting access to affordable housing in rapidly-developing, high-mobility urban areas; a successful housing policy, for example, would include incentives to build more and denser housing stock. However, as @freemark2019 shows, supply-side policies focused on upzoning do not necessarily result in the reduction of rents and housing prices or the expansion of the housing stock (let alone the expansion of the supply of *affordable* housing). I contend that the elasticity of the housing supply is itself endogenously determined through conflict between landlords, developers, capitalists, and worker-tenants. Essentially, I hope to describe the way that economic power is exerted through the markets for land and housing. 

[Something about mechanisms]

1. Rapidly accelerating economies of agglomeration, which magnify the short-side power wielded by owners of land in particular geographic locations

2. Falling rates of profit in the industrial sector (in general), reducing the long-side power of workers and tenants (expressed through legal and non-legal methods of landlord supervision and exclusion)

3. Increased consolidation of land ownership and land development firms (in the first case, as a result of the widening gap between home prices and incomes and in the second, due to the increased barriers to entry to development in urban centers)

4. The Henry George Effect: Related to (1), the massive positive externalities to urban development lead to the underproduction of housing, and the severe underproduction of *affordable* housing. 

Notice that in each of the above cases, the fortunes of the real estate sector is inextricably linked to the productive (corporate) sector.

# Rent Control Revisited: Is it Good, Actually?

## Abstract

## Research Questions

1. **Who benefited from the relaxation of rent control regulations in a number of American cities during the period 1965-1995? What impact did this have on growth and distribution (between wages, profits, and rents)? The supply of housing?**

2. **Who would benefit from a current imposition of rent control in urban rental markets?**
