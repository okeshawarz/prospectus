# Prospectus

## General

Current status: I've figured out the general topics for each of my essays.
I need to proceed now to methodologies and specific research questions.

## Essay 1

### To-do

1. Narrow down topic and research question

### Essay Summary

This essay is about the role of the real estate sector in intra- and
inter-urban inequality. 

## Essay 2

### To-do

1. Select research question 

2. Find sources of data
    * Chetty has place-level mobility data
    * Look into the possibility of scraping data for land use and zoning cases. 
    * I should be able to find data on urban migrations from... somewhere. See
      derenoncourt. 

### Essay Summary

This essay is on the role of regional institutions in creating and re-creating
spatial and racial inequality. Specifically, I start with perspective of the
socio-spatial dialectic. Chetty finds that there are differential
neighborhood-level effects on income mobility. I conjecture that these effects
are actually shaped by historical social and legal institutions. I investigate
the effects of several different types of institutions on intergenerational
wealth/income inequality. Specifically, I look at: changes in zoning laws,
neighborhoods that have been historically redlined, and changes in federal
housing laws.

## Essay 3

### To-do

1. Basic descriptive statistics. I want:
    * Some way of pointing out superstar firms
    * Their numbers in particular industries and their regional densities
    * The time and type of subsidies and concessions

2. Look for data. Specifically, I need: 
    * Statistics on revenues and locations (Economic Census)
    * Legal/political data on concessions/development plans
    * Local-area economic data

### Essay Summary

This essay will be about the effect of firm location decisions on regional
growth and inequality. Specifically, this essay will ask the following
questions:

1. Do certain firms ("superstars") gain an advantage in bargaining for
   concessions from city governments?

2. What is the nature of this advantage? In other words, what is the mechanism
   by which these firms gain power over the urban state? 

3. Do these deals provide the intended result (in terms of e.g. income growth,
   job growth, etc.)?

4. Would firms be profitable without local subsidy? 

5. Who loses? In other words, is there a Ricardian equivalence effect where tax
   incentives and cuts to services result in a redistribution of income from
   low-income workers to high-income workers? If so, through which mechanism
   (i.e. increases in housing costs, commute times, 2nd-order firm level
   effects)

6. Are there any intra-firm spatial effects that SS firms have on non SS firms
   (e.g. do they make it easier, harder for entry, do they change the wage
   distribution, do they make rents higher or lower)

7. How do these firms cluster? Is the agglomeration effect worth it in order to
   make e.g. TIOLI offers?
