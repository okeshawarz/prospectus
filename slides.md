## Introduction: The "Spatial Turn" in Economics

* Space and Scale matter!

* Questions of Urbanization and Spatial Inequality have become important 

* Specifically, questions of inter-city inequality and intra-city inequality
  (and gentrification)

## Introduction: the Socio-Spatial Dialectic

* Theorizing space outside of economics has a long, and continuing history

* For this dissertation, I rely heavily on analyses by Geographers, e.g. Harvey
  and Soja

* Key idea: Social Relations are shaped by Spatial Relations. Economic phenomena
  cannot be divorced from social and institutional context

## Introduction: the Socio-Spatial Dialectic

* Prior: Spatial relations are determined by social relations, and are
  determined by them

* In this dissertation, I focus on several aspects of key social/spatial
  relationship: Land ownership. 
    *  What determines land value? What determines the ability to extract rent?
       How are these shaped by social, political, legal institutions?  

* **Who captures the gains from "city-ness"? How do patterns of land ownership
  determine the right to the city?**

## Introduction: Structure of the Dissertation

* This dissertation will consist of three essays: Theory, History, Policy

* Broadly, this dissertation is focused on the themes of urban space and land
  rents from a Marxian perspective

* Chapters:
    1. Focuses on the institution of land ownership and class of landlords in
       developed urban economies. Propose that rent is a form of distributive
       conflict over the national (regional) product and discuss the parameters
       of that conflict.
    
    2. Focuses on the history and development of San Francisco in the context of
       land rents. Based on previous essay, this also includes historical
       analysis of the development of hi-tech capitalism and wage pressure in
       the city. 
    
    3. Focuses on Rent control. Uses a DD estimation strategy to evaluate the
       overall impacts of rent control in 99 New Jersey cities. 

## What do Landlords Do? The Political Economy of Urban Growth and Distribution

![](images/rent-wage-poster.jpg){width=80%}

## What do Landlords Do? 

### Research Questions

1. To what extent are gains from public goods and productivity increases
   captured by landlords?

2. How does the particular nature of urban growth (agglomeration, long-lived
   structures) affect the distributions of wages, profits, and rents? 

3. What is the relationship between wages, profits, and rents in an urban
   economy? 


## What do Landlords Do? 

### Motivation

* Most theory surrounding cities, land, and rents is done in the context of the
  Standard Spatial Equilibrium Model (SEM)

* SEM equilibrium conditions: consumers maximize utility s.t. indifferent to
  other locations, producers maximize profit s.t indifferent to other locations

* On this view, by far the most popular, excess housing cost growth is
  supply-side phenomenon, i.e. spatial mismatch (e.g. between jobs and housing,
  Moretti [2013]) or housing supply constraints (Glaeser 2008). 

## What do Landlords Do? 

### Motivation

* What is the relationship between growth and rent?

* Standard Urban Model argues rising rents a (housing) supply-side phenomenon
  $\rightarrow$ relax supply constraints, build more housing 

* Still missing pieces of the puzzle:
    * Glaeser (2008): "[the fact that] highly elastic places had price booms is
      one of the strange facts of the recent price explosion
    * Freemark (2019) finds upzoning has no significant effect on housing supply,
      but *increased* land values and rents
    * Agrawal et. al (2019) found that increases in the minimum wage in 29 states
      counteracted by increases in rents after 5 years

## What do Landlords Do? 

### Theorizing the Urban

* Some drawbacks of this approach:
    1. Difficulty in explaining neighborhood structure
    2. Usually (but not always) assumes perfectly competitive land & housing
       markets
    3. Uses CES production functions that are CRS $\rightarrow$ no scale
       economies, CBD has to be assumed *ex-ante* 
    4. Space appears only as Cartesian distance (i.e., a parameter indicating
       transportation costs). Related to: 
    5. Land "rents" in the sense of *economic rent*, ignoring properties of land
       *ownership* as institution

## What do Landlords Do? 

* What is rent? Textbook definitions: 
    1. "Extra payment for use of a resource by virtue of its scarcity"
    2. "Payment to a factor of production in excess of that necessary to bring
       it into production"

* Both definitions *obscure* distinctive features of *land and land rents.*

* Land rents featured heavily in Classical Political Economy, but disappeared
  after John Bates Clark and marginal productivity theory

* Classical theorists engaged with land rents almost entirely in the context of
  agriculture; this essay will examine the particular case of *urban* (i.e.,
  residential) rents

## What do Landlords Do? 

### Land as a factor of production

* "Non-produced resource" with (globally) fixed supply and differential
  productivity (what is an "efficient" return to land ownership?)

* Landownership grants *monopoly right of exclusion to a particular space.*

* Landlords are a *subsumed class* engaging in a *subsumed class process;*
  necessary for the existence of the *fundamental class process*.
    * A critical question: Do urban landlords act as a class? Through what
      mechanisms? What advances the landlord class' interests?  

* Land dropped as independent factor, itself subsumed under capital, when
  marginalism became dominant 

## What do Landlords Do? 

### Land in the Urban Context

* Classical land rents based on the "natural fertility" of agricultural or
  mining land. What determines rent payments for *residential* land?

* Residential land is valuable in the sense that it provides housing for
  workers; workers can only pay rent insofar as they are paid a wage;
  residential rents are a *redistribution* from the *urban capitalist* to the *urban
  landlord*, with the worker as intermediary. 

* Conjecture: the level of rent depends on the productivity of the capitalist
  sector. Under certain conditions, landlords are able to capture some or all of
  productivity growth in a particular area. 

## What do Landlords Do? 

### Classical Views of Rent

#### Ricardo

* *Ricardian rent* arises from differences in fertility between different plots of
agricultural land. As less fertile land comes under cultivation, the landlord
owning land of higher fertility can charge arbitrarily high rent equal to the
difference between the value of the the product on own land and the value of the
product of the least fertile (marginal) land. 

* As agriculture spreads to more and more marginal land, more and more of the
  national product will be consumed unproductively (as rent). 

* Policy proposal: Abolish the corn laws. Remove trade barriers between fertile
  lands of the British empire. Liquidate the English landlords.

## What do Landlords Do? 

### Marx

* In addition to Ricardian differential rent: Differential Rent II based on
  different levels of capital invested in agriculture (see Basu[2018])

* Absolute Rent: due to landlords' *class power*, they are able to hold land out
  of production in order to force the capitalist landlord to earn the
  *economy-wide average rate of profit*. 

* Landlords are a subsumed class in direct production (i.e., commercial &
  industrial real estate) but also through residential real estate and the
  *production of Labor-power.* Thus, residential rent is paid by the
  *capitalist* to the *landlord* for access to *labor power* of a certain type
  and location. 
    * **Critical Question:** What is are the parameters of this bargain? Do
      higher rents simply show up as higher wages? 

## What do Landlords Do? 

### Henry George

* George was the first to consider *urban* land rents

* Population density *itself* caused an increase in the productivity of labor
  "...which attaches not to labor generally, but only to labor exerted on
  particular land."

* Thus, capital gains from an increase in land value represent value *capture*
  by landlords, and represented social waste that inhibited productive accumulation

* Key points:
    1. Urban production has significant economies of scale and agglomeration;
       density $\rightarrow$ productivity $\rightarrow$ wages $\rightarrow$ rents
    2. Urban agglomeration has significant external productivity effects, the
       benefit of which accrue to landlords in the form of capital gains-- the
       "unearned increment"
    3. In the case of land *abundance*, i.e. in the United States, the urban
       boundary is not determined by the rate of profit in agriculture but the
       commuting zone around the capitalist firms

## What do Landlords Do?

### Henry George

#### Georgist Policy Proposals:

* Land Value Tax: Tax away the *entirety* of increase in the value of bare land,
  "the unearned increment."
  This would obviously not impact the supply of land, but prevent speculation
  and socially internalize public and private externalities to urban growth

* Question: How would this impact land markets? If capital gains from increased
  land value were taxed away, then land value increases from e.g. investment in
  public transportation would be recaptured by gov't

* *Nationalize* land 

## What do Landlords Do? 

### Discussion

* This essay will consist of two main parts. The first is a HET on land and land
  rents from Smith to Keynes, with a particular emphasis on Marx and George. How
  do we take them out of the agricultural context? 

* Integrating ideas of Critical Geographers will also be critical here. The idea
  is to understand the historical views of landlords in Economic theory.

## What do Landlords Do? 

### Discussion


* The second part of this essay will formalize this into a
  "classical-Marxian-Georgist" model of urban growth and distribution.
  Importantly, it must take into account the following factors:
    1. Returns to scale and returns to agglomeration
    2. immigration and emigration
    3. Distributional conflict between landlords, workers, and capitalists

* This part may prove to be the most difficult. I have grown more sympathetic to
  New Economic Geography theory by Krugman et al that adapt North-South trade
  models and incorporate IRS. Is it possible to think of agglomeration in a
  Neo-Ricardian framework (of e.g. Harvey, Sraffa, etc.) 

## On The Housing Question in San Francisco

### Research Qestions

1. How were gains to urban growth in SF distributed between wages and rents? How
   much of the return to public and private invested captured by landlords?

2. Are high rents caused by wages, or are high wages the result of high rents?
   What are the historical features of this division (e.g. institutional
   factors, political struggle, etc.)

3. How does the geography of *firms* affect the functional distribution of
   income? 

## On The Housing Question in San Francisco

### Introduction

* This essay will apply the theoretical conclusions developed in the previous
  essay into a historical account of the growth and development of San
  Francisco.
  
* This essay will rely primarily on descriptive statistics, archival data, and
  GIS mapping to examine spatial historical patterns of rent growth, firm
  location, labor migration, and housing supply in post-Crisis San Francisco.

## On The Housing Question in San Francisco

### Introduction

* Bay Area the focus of massive private and public investment, high wage growth,
  high rent growth

* Key feature: San Francisco industrial growth experiences high agglomerative
  effect; mainstream literature identifies the mechanism as functioning through
  concentrations of human capital by ways of "knowledge spillovers"

* Urban politics characterized on the one hand by powerful real estate (but not
  *real estate developer*) interests and on the other hand by successively
  greater waves of technology capital

* San Francisco also faces physical constraints to sprawl: The Pacific Ocean 

## On The Housing Question in San Francisco

* Balance of forces in San Francisco draws out key questions of the dissertation:
  How do the capitalist sector and the real estate sector interact to produce a
  given level of land value and rent? 

* Schematically, the clustering of firms "valorizes" the land via the labor
  market, which landlords then capture through monopoly control of land.

* Several historically-specific mechanisms for this capture: zoning laws,
  building height restrictions, historical designation 

## On The Housing Question in San Francisco

### The Firm Geography of the City

* Several authors (Mcneill 2017, Stehlin 2016) have written on transformation of
  urban space in the Bay Area into "shop floors" of high-tech labor process

* In this case, both direct production of commodities *and* spaces of
  consumption become avenues for the extraction of value.

* What does this conflict look like from the perspective of the
  Neoclassical/Ricardian/Georgist landlord? What payment does the landlord
  require in order to "buy in" to this process? What does it take for capital to
  intervene *directly* against the landlord class (in the case of FAANG
  investment into housing and parallel private infrastructure)

## On The Housing Question in San Francisco

### Methodology

* This essay will be primarily historical. It aims to document the following:

   1. Patterns of investment, productivity, and migration into the City
   following the 2008 crisis

   2. Changes in wages at the neighborhood level over the period

   3. Changes in rents and housing construction over the period

   4. The role of political and institutional conflict over dividing the gains
      from productivity increase 


## On The Housing Question in San Francisco

### Discussion

* The focus here is on the specific historical relationships between urban
  growth, wages, and rents

* Data on rents is surprisingly difficult to come by. But there are interesting
  proxies in "Big Data"-- Short Term Rental data from AirBnB, Zillow scrapes and ZTRAX database 

## Rent Control Revisited: Is it Good, Actually?

### Research Questions

1. To what extent is the housing supply affected by rent regulation? 

2. To what extent is the *rental* housing supply affected by rent regulation

3. To what extent do rent controls accomplish the goals of maintaining housing
   affordability and neighborhood stability? 

## Rent Control Revisited

### Introduction

* This essay is a contribution to the empirical literature on rent control

* Widespread theoretical opposition to RC, but little empirical evidence

* Empirical assessments hampered by small sample size, lack of data on rents

* This essay will examine the case of rent control in New Jersey cities using a
  Difference-in-differences approach with fixed-effects. 


## Rent Control Revisited

### The Case *Against* Rent Control

* RC is a price control $\rightarrow$ undersupply of housing, deadweight loss;
  causes landlords to convert from rental to owner-occupied housing

* RC leads to "misallocation" of housing; people consume either too much or too
  little housing in order to remain in rent-controlled units

* It makes economists really, *really* mad

## Rent Control Revisited

### The Case *For* Rent Control

* Modern RC laws do not apply to new construction; NPV of housing after 30+
  years is negligible, so should be the supply effect

* Misallocation and rental conversions are the result of *loopholes* in RC laws;
  a policy that can be remedied

* Arguments on other than efficiency grounds: normative benefits to
  neighborhood stability and anti-gentrification

## Rent Control Revisited

### What Does the Evidence Say?

* Not much-- hampered by heterogeneity in RC laws and lack of data on rents

* Diamond et. al (2018) cited widely: examined the impact of a change in RC laws
  in San Francisco. But this did not separate out the effects of a change in
  *State* laws contemporaneous with the treatment effect

* Sims (2007) and Autor (2014) examine effects of *end* of rent control laws in
  Massachusetts-- find that ending rent control raised rents and property
  values, even in never-controlled properties

* Gilderbloom and Ye (2007) and Ambrosius (2015) examine rent control laws in
  New Jersey 30 and 40 years after passing using cross-sectional analysis. Find
  very little effect of rent control on housing stock or rents.  

## Rent Control Revisited

### Major Questions

A. How does rent control impact the supply of housing, and rents?

B. What is the direction of causation? Does rent control cause high rents in the
long run (cf. Diamond et. al) or do high rents cause cities to enact rent
control? 

## Rent Control Revisited

### Data

* This essay will rely on the American Housing Survey Metropolitan Sample

* Restricted-use microdata exists at the unit of the structure; I will use this
  if available. Otherwise, the smallest level of geography is the *zone*.

* Each MSA is sampled once every 6 years, yielding a panel data set of 4 time
  periods (1980-2004)

* A database of cities with rent control and the details of their enactment is
  provided by the New Jersey Department of Consumer Affairs.

## Rent Control Revisited

### Data

![Massachusetts zones, from Sims 2007](images/sims-zonemap.png){width=85%}

## Rent Control Revisited

### Methodology

#### Specification 1

I will estimate the following DD model with fixed effects:
$$ y_{ijy} = \alpha_{i} + \delta_j + \gamma_{y} + \beta_t R_{ijy} +  \epsilon_{ijy}, $$

for the zone-level DD specification where, for zone $i$ in metropolitan area $j$, and year $y$,
$y_{ijy}$ is a vector of the outcome variables
[total housing stock in zone $i$, percent of rental units in $i$, average rent, average length of rental tenure],
$\alpha$ is zone fixed effects,
$\delta$ is metropolitan area fixed effects, and
$\gamma$ is year fixed effects.
$R_{ijy}$ is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if the zone was subject to rent control during year *y* and 0 otherwise,
and $\epsilon_{ijy}$ is the error term.

## Rent Control Revisited

### Methodology

#### Specification 2

In this specification, I employ a specification that accounts for
heterogeneity across rent regulation regimes. In particular, I want to
examine the impact of vacancy decontrol provisions on the outcome variables
of interest. To do this, I simply estimate a similar equation

$$ y_{ijy} = \alpha_{i} + \delta_j + \gamma_{y} + \beta_t R^T_{ijy} +  \epsilon_{ijy}, $$

where
$R^T$ now takes the value
0 if the zone is not rent-controlled in year $y$,
1 if the zone is rent controlled but without decontrol provisions in year $y$, or
2 if the zone is rent controlled with a decontrol provision in year $y$.

## Rent Control Revisited

### Discussion

* This specification compares zones that have rent control (a small number) with
  *all* zones in the MSA that do not have rent control (a large number). It
  might be better to use some kind of matching to designate immediate
  cross-border zones as the controls

* This does not strongly imply causation. For that I could possibly use an IV
  approach. 

* How to deal with: 
   1. Spatial autocorrelation
   2. Heterogeneity in treatment-year effects. New Jersey cities implemented
      rent control during different time periods. A new strand of DD literature
      deals with this problem, which... I haven't read (yet)

# The End. Thank you!
