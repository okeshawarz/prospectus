## What do Landlords Do? The Political Economy of Urban Growth and Distribution

![](images/rent-wage-poster.jpg){width=70%}

## What do Landlords Do? 

### Research Questions

1. To what extent are gains from public goods and productivity increases
   captured by landlords?

2. How does the particular nature of urban growth (agglomeration, long-lived
   structures) affect the distributions of wages, profits, and rents? 

3. What is the relationship between wages, profits, and rents in an urban
   economy? 

## What do Landlords Do? 

### Motivation

* What is the relationship between growth and rent?

* Standard Urban Model argues rising rents a (housing) supply-side phenomenon
  $\rightarrow$ relax supply constraints, build more housing 

* Still missing pieces of the puzzle:
    * @glaeser2008: "[the fact that] highly elastic places had price booms is
      one of the strange facts of the recent price explosion
    * @freemark2019 finds upzoning has no significant effect on housing supply,
      but *increased* land values and rents
    * @agarwal2019 found that increases in the minimum wage in 29 states
      counteracted by increases in rents after 5 years

## What do Landlords Do? 

* What is rent? Textbook definitions: 
    1. "Extra payment for use of a resource by virtue of its scarcity"
    2. "Payment to a factor of production in excess of that necessary to bring
       it into production"

* Both definitions *obscure* distinctive features of *land and land rents.*

* Land rents featured heavily in Classical Political Economy, but disappeared
  after John Bates Clark and marginal productivity theory

* Classical theorists engaged with land rents almost entirely in the context of
  agriculture; this essay will examine the particular case of *urban* (i.e.,
  residential) rents

## What do Landlords Do? 

### Land as a factor of production

* "Non-produced resource" with (globally) fixed supply and differential
  productivity (what is an "efficient" return to land ownership?)

* Landownership grants *monopoly right of exclusion to a particular space.*

* Landlords are a *subsumed class* engaging in a *subsumed class process;*
  necessary for the existence of the *fundamental class process*.
    * A critical question: Do urban landlords act as a class? Through what
      mechanisms? What advances the landlord class' interests?  

## What do Landlords Do? 

### Land in the Urban Context

* Classical land rents based on the "natural fertility" of agricultural or
  mining land. What determines rent payments for *residential* land?

* Residential land is valuable in the sense that it provides housing for
  workers; workers can only pay rent insofar as they are paid a wage;
  residential rents are a *redistribution* from the *urban capitalist* to the *urban
  landlord*, with the worker as intermediary. 

* Conjecture: the level of rent depends on the productivity of the capitalist
  sector. Under certain conditions, landlords are able to capture some or all of
  productivity growth in a particular area. 

## What do Landlords Do? 

### Classical Views of Rent

#### Ricardo

* *Ricardian rent* arises from differences in fertility between different plots of
agricultural land. As less fertile land comes under cultivation, the landlord
owning land of higher fertility can charge arbitrarily high rent equal to the
difference between the value of the the product on own land and the value of the
product of the least fertile (marginal) land. 

* As agriculture spreads to more and more marginal land, more and more of the
  national product will be consumed unproductively (as rent). 

* Policy proposal: Abolish the corn laws. Remove trade barriers between fertile
  lands of the British empire. Liquidate the English landlords.

## What do Landlords Do? 

### Marx

* In addition to Ricardian differential rent: Differential Rent II based on
  different levels of capital invested in agriculture (see @basu2018)

* Absolute Rent: due to landlords' *class power*, they are able to hold land out
  of production in order to force the capitalist landlord to earn the
  *economy-wide average rate of profit*. 

* Landlords are a subsumed class in direct production (i.e., commercial &
  industrial real estate) but also through residential real estate and the
  *production of Labor-power.* Thus, residential rent is paid by the
  *capitalist* to the *landlord* for access to *labor power* of a certain type
  and location. 
    * **Critical Question:** What is are the parameters of this bargain? Do
      higher rents simply show up as higher wages? 

## What do Landlords Do? 

### Henry George

* George was the first to consider *urban* land rents

* Population density *itself* caused an increase in the productivity of labor
  "...which attaches not to labor generally, but only to labor exerted on
  particular land."

* Key points:
    1. Urban production has significant economies of scale and agglomeration;
       density $\rightarrow$ productivity $\rightarrow$ wages $\rightarrow$ rents
    2. Urban agglomeration has significant external productivity effects, the
       benefit of which accrue to landlords in the form of capital gains-- the
       "unearned increment"

## What do Landlords Do? 

### Structure of the Essay

#### History of Economic Thought on Land and Land Rents

1. Review of classical thinking on land rents, from Smith to Keynes, with a
   particular focus on Marx and George
2. How do we apply this to urban land rents in developed economies? 

#### A Model Urban Growth and Distribution

1. Formalize theoretical insights on class, urban growth, and land rents

2. Model distribution of wages, profits, rents in an urban economy. 


## On The Housing Question in San Francisco

### Research Qestions

1. How were gains to urban growth in SF distributed between wages and rents? How
   much of the return to public and private invested captured by landlords?

2. Are high rents caused by wages, or are high wages the result of high rents?
   What are the historical features of this division (e.g. institutional
   factors, political struggle, etc.)

3. How does the geography of *firms* affect the functional distribution of
   income? 

## On The Housing Question in San Francisco

### Introduction

* This essay will apply the theoretical conclusions developed in the previous
  essay into a historical account of the growth and development of San
  Francisco.
  
* This essay will rely primarily on descriptive statistics, archival data, and
  GIS mapping to examine spatial historical patterns of rent growth, firm
  location, labor migration, and housing supply in post-Crisis San Francisco.

## Rent Control Revisited: Is it Good, Actually?

### Research Questions

1. To what extent is the housing supply affected by rent regulation? 

2. To what extent is the *rental* housing supply affected by rent regulation

3. To what extent do rent controls accomplish the goals of maintaining housing
   affordability and neighborhood stability? 

## Rent Control Revisited

### Introduction

* This essay is a contribution to the empirical literature on rent control

* Widespread theoretical opposition to RC, but little empirical evidence

* Empirical assessments hampered by small sample size, lack of data on rents

* This essay will examine the case of rent control in New Jersey cities using a
  Difference-in-differences approach with fixed-effects. 


## Rent Control Revisited

### The Case *Against* Rent Control

* RC is a price control $\rightarrow$ undersupply of housing, deadweight loss;
  causes landlords to convert from rental to owner-occupied housing

* RC leads to "misallocation" of housing; people consume either too much or too
  little housing in order to remain in rent-controlled units

## Rent Control Revisited

### The Case *For* Rent Control

* Modern RC laws do not apply to new construction; NPV of housing after 30+
  years is negligible, so should be the supply effect

* Misallocation and rental conversions are the result of *loopholes* in RC laws;
  a policy that can be remedied

* Arguments on other than efficiency grounds: normative benefits to
  neighborhood stability and anti-gentrification

## Rent Control Revisited

### What Does the Evidence Say?

* Not much-- hampered by heterogeneity in RC laws and lack of data on rents

* Diamond et. al (2018) cited widely: examined the impact of a change in RC laws
  in San Francisco. But this did not separate out the effects of a change in
  *State* laws contemporaneous with the treatment effect

* Sims (2007) and Autor (2014) examine effects of *end* of rent control laws in
  Massachusetts-- find that ending rent control raised rents and property
  values, even in never-controlled properties

* Gilderbloom and Ye (2007) and Ambrosius (2015) examine rent control laws in
  New Jersey 30 and 40 years after passing using cross-sectional analysis. Find
  very little effect of rent control on housing stock or rents.  

## Rent Control Revisited

### Major Questions

A. How does rent control impact the supply of housing, and rents?

B. What is the direction of causation? Does rent control cause high rents in the
long run (cf. Diamond et. al) or do high rents cause cities to enact rent
control? 

## Rent Control Revisited

### Data

* This essay will rely on the American Housing Survey Metropolitan Sample

* Restricted-use microdata exists at the unit of the structure; I will use this
  if available. Otherwise, the smallest level of geography is the *zone*.

* Each MSA is sampled once every 6 years, yielding a panel data set of 4 time
  periods (1980-2004)

* A database of cities with rent control and the details of their enactment is
  provided by the New Jersey Department of Consumer Affairs.

## Rent Control Revisited

### Methodology

#### Specification 1

* I will use a difference-in-differences estimated strategy. The goal is to
  compare the treated observations (which are zones that are within a
  municipality that enacted rent control at a given time) to a control group
  (zones that were never under RC)

* I will estimate the following DD model with fixed effects:
$$ y_{ijy} = \alpha_{i} + \delta_j + \gamma_{y} + \beta_t R_{ijy} +  \epsilon_{ijy}, $$

for the zone-level DD specification where, for zone $i$ in metropolitan area $j$, and year $y$,
$y_{ijy}$ is a vector of the outcome variables
[total housing stock in zone $i$, percent of rental units in $i$, average rent, average length of rental tenure],
$\alpha$ is zone fixed effects,
$\delta$ is metropolitan area fixed effects, and
$\gamma$ is year fixed effects.
$R_{ijy}$ is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if the zone was subject to rent control during year *y* and 0 otherwise,
and $\epsilon_{ijy}$ is the error term.

## Rent Control Revisited

### Methodology

#### Specification 2

In this specification, I employ a specification that accounts for
heterogeneity across rent regulation regimes. In particular, I want to
examine the impact of vacancy decontrol provisions on the outcome variables
of interest. To do this, I simply estimate a similar equation

$$ y_{ijy} = \alpha_{i} + \delta_j + \gamma_{y} + \beta_t R^T_{ijy} +  \epsilon_{ijy}, $$

where
$R^T$ now takes the value
0 if the zone is not rent-controlled in year $y$,
1 if the zone is rent controlled but without decontrol provisions in year $y$, or
2 if the zone is rent controlled with a decontrol provision in year $y$.

## Rent Control Revisited

### Discussion

* This specification compares zones that have rent control (a small number) with
  *all* zones in the MSA that do not have rent control (a large number). It
  might be better to use some kind of matching to designate immediate
  cross-border zones as the controls

* This does not strongly imply causation. For that I could possibly use an IV
  approach.
