# Essay 1 - On the Housing Question: Public Housing and Urban Structure

## Introduction to the Question

On balance, what has the effect of U.S. housing policy in American urban
spaces? This essay approaches the question from the perspective of public
housing. Specifically, it analyzes the historical development of public
housing sites in various urban locales, their percieved failures, and
their replacement policy in the form of HOPE IV community development
grants in the context of urban development. Specifically, I ask:

1. What accounts for the problems of public housing in the United States?

2. What are the welfare effects of the HOPE IV program?

3. Is urban housing policy in the neoliberal era orientated towards
   gentrification (in the words of @fraser2013, "internal colonization")?

## Literature Review

a. The Dual Nature of Housing: Investment Good and Wage Good

b. The History of Housing Policy in the United States

c. The Regional Dimensions of the Housing Crisis

## A Model

I model the production of public housing as 

a. a public goods game

b. a coalitional game, in which competing interests form political
   coalitions to bargain for ground rents over long cycles of neighborhood
   development

## Data and Method

a. Longitudinal data on public housing residents would be useful.
   @chetty2017 used private SSA data to track residents as they moved
   through neighborhoods; with access to this data, I could do the same
   for residents of various public housing/HOPE VI sites

b. Census microdata and GIS-linked data on census tracts surrounding
   public housing projects and HOPE VI sites.

# Essay 1 (Alternate) - On the Housing Question: Real Estate and the Labor Share

## Introduction to the Question

Recently, the literature has focused its attention on the fall of the labor
share, in contravention of Kaldor's stylized growth facts (e.g., @autor2017).
@rognlie2015 points out that, exclusive of housing, capital's share of
growth has remained relatively constant-- it is in fact growth in the
__housing__ sector that accounts for the decline in the share going to
labor, contrary to explanations relying on shifts in bargaining power
between workers and capitalists. How do we account for the rise of real
estate capital? What is the bargaining problem between workers and
landlords? What is the link between housing and the reserve army of labor
(Consider: when firms' demand for labor increases, the demand for urban
housing also increases, with gains from productivity accruing to the
landholder. Is this a resurrection of Ricardo's old fear of the rentier
class?)?

## Literature Review

## A Model

I construct, following @shaikh2016, a Goodwin-Kalecki model incorporating a housing sector.

# Essay 2 - Zoning and Inequality

Is the housing crisis linked to supply constraints? Specifically, are
zoning regulations the cause of rapid growth in housing prices and rent
[@glaeser2008]?

## Introduction to the Question

## Literature Review

a. The Politics of Zoning Policy

b. Empirical Literature on Metropolitan Home Prices

c. Macro literature on housing policy & supply restrictions

d. Production of Housing: Monopolistic or competitive? In which markets?

## Data and Method

Changes in zoning regulations in districts that cross municipal/state
boundaries provide a source of exogenous variation to test the differential
impacts of zoning laws on wealth/income inequality, segregation, homeownership,
etc. I can construct a dataset that uses a contigious county/district approach
similar to Dube [-@dube2010] to estimate these hypotheses. Alternately,
I can construct a dataset of land use court cases and use them as sources
of exogenous variation.

# Essay 3 - Superstar Firms: a Firm-level Perspective on Regional Inequality

## Introduction

Up until the mid-1990s, cities and city-regions experienced convergence in
productivity and wages. Since then, this trend has reversed itself, and
metropolitan areas in the United States began to diverge, with the largest
urban conglomerations experiencing the greatest growth in productivity and
smaller cities and suburbs lagging behind [@giannone2017; @ganong2017]. At
the same time, superstar cities have become largely unaffordable for
middle- and lower- class residents [@autor2013].

Attempts to explain this divergence have largely focused on skill-biased
technical change [@glaeser2009] and over-regulation of the housing supply
[@glaeser2008] within the context of the canonical neoclassical spatial
equilibrium model. This essay, inspired by the relatively new literature
on superstar firms [@autor2017], approaches the question from a different
angle: to what extent is regional divergence driven by heavily
consolidated, hyper-productive superstar firms? What are the consequences
(with respect to the ability of the urban state to support social
reproduction) for urban regions that attract (or attempt to attract)
superstar firms? What are the terms of the bargaining game between cities
and superstar firms?

## Literature Review

### Superstars and Superstar Firms

@rosen1981 provides an early formal treatment of the superstar phenomenon
in labor markets; this is a special type of assignment problem in which
there is a "marked concentration of output on those few sellers who have
the most talent." Rosen attempts to show that this is because of the
convexity of the seller's net revenue function (due to the relative
insubstitutability of outputs of various types of quality) and in
industries where the costs of production "do not rise in proportion to the
size of a seller's market."

@autor2017 directly addresses the effects of superstar *firms* on the
decline in the labor share. They find that in industries with increasing
concentration, the labor share of income falls due to a re-allocation of
sales between firms, and in the most highly-concentrated industries, the
labor share falls. These insights point the way forward to the question
I address-- what are the *spatial* dimensions of these inequalities? Does
superstardom have a significant effect on 1) the urban/regional
distribution of income, and 2) how do these firms interact with the
political environment of a city/region? 

a. Good People or Good Citizens? Glaeser vs. Acemoglu (vs. Bowles)

b. Theories of firm agglomeration and hyper-agglomeration

### Scale and Urban Governance

a. "Glocalization" of municipal governments
