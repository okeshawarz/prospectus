# Condensed Notes from IO Presentation

Stylized fact: Greater income share going to housing than to corporate capital (This may or may not be true at the macro scale, but this could be true at smaller scales). 

The *Regulation View:* Restrictive building regulations are the source of
"excessive" housing price growth. Hsieh and Moretti claim that building
restrictions are responsible for a 30% contraction in potential growth over the
past half-century. This is the generally accepted view, and is colloquially
known as "NIMBYism." Jason Furman, for example, argued extensively for the
rapid deregulation of local housing markets under the Obama administration.
Ganong and Shoag, for example, attribute the decline in inter-city migration to
increased housing costs, which lead to low-skilled workers being "trapped" in
low-productivity cities that are being sorted increasingly by skill-biased
technical change. Diamond(2016) showed that the income divergence between
cities could be explained more through this type of regulation-driven skill
sorting than the college wage premium. 

In their 2002 paper, Glaeser and Gyourko use the divergence between housing prices and construction costs to show that prices in certain markets are much higher than they "should" be. Under the perfect-competition assumptions of the spatial equilibrium model, this is perfectly valid; any distortions such that prices do not equal marginal costs should be the result of market failure or government intervention. However, it is not clear to me that the construction industry can be called perfectly competitive, especially in densely-built urban sectors. 

Knoll et. al also find that 87% of housing price shifts in the United States during the last century can be attributed to changes in the price of land. So it is again unclear whether we can attribute prices in excess of marginal costs solely to regulation or something else. Here the spatial equilibrium approach is particularly poorly-suited to deal with the question of land, treating returns to land the same as capital income. 

It is here that I think a fundamental intervention is in order-- a re-spatialization of the political economy of land and urban space in the vein of George and Marx. In national accounts, land and capital both count as wealth, but capital in the Marxian sense contributes to the *creation* of value, while land rents are *sinks* of value that has already been produced. Dymski and Harvey classify this as a form of fictitious capital, whose value depends on the future value of productive enterprises located on or near to it, where nearness is a dynamical process that evolves according to technological change and political contestation. The amount of rent accrued to the owners of landed property represents a division of the surplus product between corporate capital, landlords, and workers. 

Harvey (and Marx, and George) argues that the basis for this extraction of the surplus arises from the peculiar features of land ownership-- namely that its non-reproducibility and the durability of structures added to the built environment give landlords monopoly rights of control over their particular piece of land. Now consider a relative decline in the profits of the productive capitalist sector-- since the total amount of rent extracted only indirectly depends on the level of output, profits in the real estate sector can rise as those in the productive sector fall. 

It is this theoretical point that I want to develop. Harvey argues that this gives landlords monopoly power in the form of "class monopoly rents." The prediction that rent extraction is relatively higher for poorer renters has been borne out by some empirical work. The hypothesis regarding speculator-developers remains to be convincingly argued, and this theoretical argument also requires a theory of the urban state. It is at this point that we intersect the mainstream literature, except from the opposite direction-- in this case, restrictive zoning laws are *caused by* the increase in economic power of the landowning class, rather than a *cause of* them. This could be the result of, for example, increased land monopolization of real estate firms in high-productivity areas. 

Finally, I think the ideas of Henry George are relevant:

1. Once unowned land is occupied, economic rent becomes determined by *locational* advantage-- In other words, the value of land is determined almost entirely by features external to the plot of land itself: Proximity to jobs, amenities, transit, etc. 

2. When the productivity of a city increases, the ability of landlords to capture greater shares of the surplus also increases. This is a key insight that this dissertation intends to test.
