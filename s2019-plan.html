<h2 id="dissertation-content">Dissertation Content:</h2>
<p>I have to narrow the focus of the research questions in Essay 1 and Essay 2. Essay 2 should be easiest: I should investigate the possibility of using Chetty&#8217;s neighborhood mobility effects to interrogate his conclusion. The idea is: place matters for economic mobility. But place-level characteristics are not exogenous; they themselves respond to external factors. The question is this: what are the external factors that shape the mobility-capacity of a particular place?</p>
