<li><p>Dania will be quitting at some point this year. Per Vamsi&#8217;s suggestion, I will ask him and Michael Ash to co-chair my committee. I also have to find an outside member. I will likely also add Ceren to my committee.</p></li>
<li><p>I have 5 pages of outline and lit. review so far. As per the dissertation workshop, I will shoot for a 40-page prospectus by the end of March.</p></li>

<h3 id="dissertation-content">Dissertation Content:</h3>
<p>I have to narrow the focus of the research questions in Essay 1 and Essay 2. Essay 2 should be easiest: I should investigate the possibility of using Chetty&#8217;s neighborhood mobility effects to interrogate his conclusion. The idea is: place matters for economic mobility. But place-level characteristics are not exogenous; they themselves respond to external factors. The question is this: what are the external factors that shape the mobility-capacity of a particular place?</p>
<p>Essay 1: I have no idea what I&#8217;m talking about.</p>

<li>Begin collecting stylized data for Essay 2 and Essay 3.
<ol type="a">
<li>Essay 2 requires: Chetty place-level data, mapping data for zoning laws/other institutions, outcome variables</li>
<li>Essay 3 requires: I need to build a database of superstar firms. Autor will probably have some tips. I should be able to turn this into a geocoded data set (to e.g.&#160;look at the density of superstars). I also need some record of urban policy changes (tax incentives, etc.) and a spatially-granular data set for outcome variables. The social wage literature might be helfpful here.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>At this point, I should be able to write a proper abstract for Essay 2, and possibly Essay 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish reading the relevant literature by Harvey.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish reading the relevant literature by Glaeser.</p></li>
