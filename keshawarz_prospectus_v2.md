title: "Three Essays on Urban Economics"
author: Osman Keshawarz
date: "November 15, 2019"
bibliography: [prospectus.bib]
abstract: this prospectus proposes three questions in the field of urban political economy. the first is a theoretical question on the relationship between urban growth, density, wages, profits, and rents, based on classical political economy treatments of the land question. The second essay is a historical-descriptive essay that attempts to apply the theoretical insights of the first chapter to patterns of firm location, wage increases, and land value changes in San Francisco, California. The final question is an difference-in-differences empirical study of the effects of rent control laws in New Jersey.

# Introduction: Centering Space in Political economy

This prospectus outlines a proposal for three essays on the themes of urban growth, distribution, and land use policy in the United States.
The overall motivation of this dissertation, in the broadest terms,
is to understand how rents in markets for land and housing affect economic outcomes for those living and working in urban regions^[As @lefebvre2003 would say, "the urban" is not limited merely to cities but rather to an entire global urban mode of production. I tend to agree.].
Over the course of investigating this question,
this dissertation will touch upon questions of income and wealth inequality,
agglomeration and scale economies,
growth theory,
and housing policy.

The discipline of economics has been going through something of its own "spatial turn",
lagging somewhat embarassingly behind most of the other social sciences.
It has become increasingly obvious that heterogeneity of 
outcomes across space, as well as time,
is a persistent feature of economic phenomena.
In the past few years, much has been made about "superstar cities,"
"superstar firms,"
and other highly-unequal features of the American (and indeed, global) economic geography that seem to have their own centers of gravity.
At the same time, housing crises are being proclaimed in the most prosperous of American cities,
while the rest seem to be mired in stagnation and urban decay.
The *spatiality* of American economic life is finally getting its own problematic,
as growth and decline are recognized as fundamentally place-linked.
This dissertation serves as a contribution to the spatialization of economics. 

**Talk about regular urbecon models here: Von Thunen, Muth, Standard Urban Model**

One of @soja1980's most lasting contributions was the idea of the socio-spatial dialectic,
in which social relations shape spatial relations,
which are in turn shaped by them. 
This shows up as an unevenness of social relations across space and scale,
as people and production shift from rural to urban to suburban and possibly back again,
with concomitant shifts in social practice, political culture, and economic inequality.
The tradition of radical geography, starting with @lefebvre2003, has always fundamentally been about the right to the city--
for whom does the city work, and to whom does the city (and the benefits of living therein) belong?
In this dissertation, my aim is to examine a very narrow section of the discourse on the right to the city.
The question that I am concerned with, broadly, is "how do patterns of land ownership determine the right to the city?"
The essays outlined in this prospectus are concerned with a proper subset of spatial relations,
the perhaps the most obvious ones: land ownership and land rents. 

Land and land-rents, of course, have not always been relegated to the periphery of the economics discipline.
The problem of landownership and rents were a primary concern of even the earliest classical economists. 
In *The Wealth of Nations*, Adam Smith writes:

>Ground-rents, so far as they exceed the ordinary rent of land, are altogether
>owing to the good government of the sovereign, which, by protecting the
>industry of either the whole people, or of the inhabitants of some particular
>place, enables them to pay so much more than its real value for the ground
>which they build their houses upon... Nothing can be more reasonbale than that
>a fund, which owes its existence to the good government of the state should be
>taxed peculiarly, or should contribute something more than the greater part of
>other funds, towards the support of that government. 

The pecularity of land ownership was, then, well-known to the classical thinkers, Smith, Ricardo, Marx, and Keynes.
The existence of a monopoly on *space*, which is a fundamental condition of existence (for both the production process as well as... well, anything) posed huge barriers to the well-organized accumulation of capital^[Ricardo, for example, famously argued for the abolition of the Corn Laws in England, leading to the eventual liquidation of the English gentry as a class.]. 
The tripartite division of the national product into wages, profits, and rents, was a relatively uncontroversial tenet of political economy
until John Bates Clark, armed with marginal productivity and lacking a theory of land or land-rent,
became the groundwork for the neoclassical school of economics.
This particular bit of history of economic thought will be elaborated on further in Essay 1, 
but I mention it here to motivate the contribution of this dissertation.
