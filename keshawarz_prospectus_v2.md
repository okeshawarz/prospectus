author: Osman Keshawarz
date: "November 15, 2019"
bibliography: [prospectus.bib]
abstract: this prospectus proposes three questions in the field of urban political economy. the first is a theoretical question on the relationship between urban growth, density, wages, profits, and rents, based on classical political economy treatments of the land question. The second essay is a historical-descriptive essay that attempts to apply the theoretical insights of the first chapter to patterns of firm location, wage increases, and land value changes in San Francisco, California. The final question is an difference-in-differences empirical study of the effects of rent control laws in New Jersey.

# Introduction: Centering Space in Political economy

This prospectus outlines a proposal for three essays on the themes of urban growth, distribution, and land use policy in the United States.
The overall motivation of this dissertation, in the broadest terms,
is to understand how rents in markets for land and housing affect economic outcomes for those living and working in urban regions^[As @lefebvre2003 would say, "the urban" is not limited merely to cities but rather to an entire urban mode of production. I tend to agree.].
Over the course of investigating this question,
this dissertation will touch upon questions of income and wealth inequality,
agglomeration and scale economies,
growth theory,
and housing policy.

The discipline of economics has been going through something of its own "spatial turn",
lagging somewhat embarassingly behind most of the other social sciences.
It has become increasingly obvious that heterogeneity of outcomes across space,
as well as time,
is a persistent feature of economic phenomena.
In the past few years, much has been made about "superstar cities,"
"superstar firms,"
and other highly-unequal features of the American (and indeed, global) economic geography that seem to have their own centers of gravity.
At the same time, housing crises are being proclaimed in the most prosperous of American cities,
while the rest seem to be mired in stagnation and urban decay.
The *spatiality* of American economic life is finally getting its own problematic,
as growth and decline are recognized as fundamentally place-linked.
This dissertation, then can be a contribution to the spatialization of economics.
