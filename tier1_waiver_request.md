Dear Professor Ash,

I am writing this letter to formally request an extension to Tier I funding
status as outlined in the Department Chair's memo regarding Tier I waivers.

As you know, for personal reasons between Academic Years 2016-2018, I was
delayed in the completion of my coursework and progress towards a completed
dissertation. However, this year, I have:

    1. Completed all outstanding course requirements for the Doctoral degree, and in Fall 2019,
    2. Written and successfully defended a prospectus on the topic of Urban Economics.

Accordingly, all that remains is the completion of the dissertation itself. I
plan to spend the following year working on what will become my job market
paper. I feel that, given the request of the Chair and my Advisor earlier in the year
regarding progress in the doctoral program, I have moved sufficiently forward to warrant 
continued support by the department.

Thank you,
Osman Keshawarz
