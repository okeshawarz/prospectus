# Introduction

# On the Housing Question in the United States: The Political Economy of Urban Real Estate

Research Question: *Are increasing monopoly returns in the housing sector
responsible for the growth in regional inequality?*

## Abstract 

This paper addresses several questions unaddressed in the mainstream literature
regarding real estate rents, urban structure, and regional inequality.
@rognlie2015 uses data from NIPA tables for the U.S. to show that the fall in
the share of income going to labor can be attributed to a greater share going
to the housing sector, rather than the corporate sector which has remained
remarkably stable over time. @ganong2017 and @glaeser2008 show that housing
prices rise disproportionately to income in high-income areas, causing
a displacement of low-income, primarily non-white families. Glaeser attributes
this to excess rents conferred via land-use regulations (i.e., zoning
restrictions). In this paper, I intend to show that this explanation falls
short as it 1) relies on the existence of a perfectly competitive market in
land and structures, 2) uses a neoclassical framework that ignores the social
dynamics of rent and the built environment, and 3) ignores the effects of firms
on urban structures and processes.

Instead, I construct an alternate explanation for increasing returns to housing
based on the classical political rent theories of Engels [-@engels1872], George
[-@george2017], and Harvey [-@harvey1974; -@harvey2018a] to argue that the rise
in rent-income ratios is due to an increase in the bargaining power of
land-owners and developers resulting from the stagnation and decline in the
productive capitalist sector of the (national) economy [@dymski2010a], a thesis
which I develop further in Essay 3. I use this framework to analyze at home price
dynamics and urban structure in three American cities: New Haven, CT, San
Francisco, CA, and ???.

## Proposed Argument:

1. Housing income is rising with respect to labor and capital income

2. This effect is occuring unequally across regions

3. As a result, more and more surplus is being captured by real estate

## Descriptive Statistics

1. Increase in income going to housing (reproduction from -@rognlie2015). **Can I find some way to decompose this by region?** (Answer: YES! The BEA MSA-level GDP figures and breakdowns by 2-digit NAICS codes. I can then construct measures of real estate income as a percentage of total GDP. There are some problems with this approach; this suffers from the muddling of land values and built environment values [@harvey1974]. There is also no way to distinguish housing rents from housing sales. I may be able to contact the BEA for a further breakdown.)

2. Income convergence in the United States from @ganong2017

3. Real Estate ownership patterns by city and region (i.e., how concentrated is landownership in the United States?)


# The Scales of Power: Superstar Firms and Regional Inequality

Research Question: *Do superstar firms affect the regional distribution of income by strategically bargaining for rents with urban states?*

## Abstract

## Descriptive Statistics

* Top-decile firms vs. Others -- **get from compustat**

    a. replicate @autor2018, @autor2017a - show that share of value-added (productivity?) declines for bottom 90% vs  top 10%

* Regional Effects of superstar firms: clustering and shift-share 

    a. show that there are regional clusters of the top-level firms, and that this has specific effects on land and labor markets

* Local land and labor-market effects of subsidies from @leroy2018

## Literature Review

* @swyngedouw2004a on scale changes and neoliberal urbanism

* @autor2013, @reenen2018, @giannone2017, et al on superstar firms/regional growth 

* neoclassical firm location/IO

* Something on public finance? 

## The HQ Game: A Model of Firm Location and Political Choice

The first stage of the model is a coalition game which models the political decision-making process of the city. Based on the institutional structure of the city (e.g. strong mayor vs. strong council) and the relative strengths of (rich, poor) constituents, the city determines an optimal bid to attract (or retain) a superstar firm. The bid is either open or secret. 

The second stage is an open auction between cities. Each city starts with a stock of human and physical capital, with a given prevailing wage and rental rate. Each city offers an incentive package (in the form of a tax abatement), which the firm either accepts or rejects. 

This model should be able to generate the following empirical facts:

    1. The geographic distribution of superstar firms or industries

    2. Equilibrium levels of subsidy offered by cities

    3. Changes in regional income distribution given a particular firm re-location
