# The Housing Question 

## Introduction

This is a theoretical essay on the distributional role of real estate in the urban context. I begin with macro data from @rognlie2015, showing that over the past 30 years, the decline in the labor share can be attributed to increases in income going to housing, in contravention of Kaldor's stylized facts of growth. When looking at metropolitan GDP and housing figures, a few results emerge: 

1. The share of of regional GDP going to real estate is increasing, even in cities where real estate is not the primary industry

2. Rent-income ratios in the most productive cities have risen rapidly

3. The construction of new housing has experienced a secular decline, especially within cities with the fastest income growth

4. The composition of new housing construction has changed, reflecting declining homeownership and increased rentership.

In this paper, I build an argument incorporating the critical geography and Marxist-Georgist urban economics traditions. I develop general theoretical questions regarding the role of differential rents, economies of scale, and the level of homeownership, and show that under certain conditions, all of the income growth in a particular region can be captured by landlords, and that in equilibrium, urban land markets under conditions of increasing returns may not clear.

# Real Estate State: A Story of Silicon Valley

## Introduction

This is a historical/empirical essay that builds on the theoretical arguments developed in the previous chapter. The historical portion of this chapter focuses on the political and legislative development of the real estate industry during the growth of the technology industry starting in the 1990s. This period can be split into an early period, featuring relatively high elasticities of housing supply, and a late period, featuring relatively low elasticity of supply. The empirical methodology builds on @agarwal2019, who found that increases in the Philadelphia minimum wage had been largely absorbed into higher rents. I show that, following the argument in the previous chapter, changes in the (regulatory environment/size of property developers/etc) in the late period caused the same to be true for *general* increases in income (in other words; high productivity in spatially-concentrated industry turned higher wages into transfer payments from employers to landlords).

## A History of Bay Area Real Estate

[Neighborhood development before and after GFC, including major court cases, major developments, tenant/owner fights, something similar to ]

## Data and Methodology

Bay Area cities should have relatively well-established data on land prices and rents. I need to think of a specification to show what happens to rents when the average (median) income of a neighborhood increases, to control for increased demand and migration. If I had the *perfect* data set, it would include:

* Median incomes for renters in a particular location,

* Rents for those particular locations

* Housing units, owner-occupied vs. rented over the time period

* Number of building permits issued in the location

I should be able to similarly use a DID approach. Where @agarwal2019 used lease-agreements as a proxy for minimum wage-earners' budget constraints, I would have to find a different dependent variable. The equation to be estimated would be something like:

$$ \Delta rent_i = \Beta_1 \Delta medianwage_i + \gamma controls $$

Where I could compare those neighborhoods/metro areas that had the features identified in chapter 1 to those that did not. 

## Results and Conclusion

# Rent Control, Neighborhood Stability, and Economic Mobility

## Introduction

One need only to mention the phrase "rent control" to an economist to hear the reflexive Lindbeck quote about aerial bombardment, accompanied by a radioactive level of smugness. Rent control is considered as solved a problem as any, with the consensus of the entire discipline holding that rent control is as wasteful as any price control, resulting the lower housing quality, housing shortages, and paradoxically higher rents (e.g. @diamond2018). Yet, despite this, in the face of spiralling housing costs in many of the metro areas of the USA, many municipalities are calling for (and enacting) rent control legislation. 

In a distributive-conflict framework, residential rent is a payment that a landlord extracts from a tenant through the threat of displacement via eviction. Rent control provides a check on this ability, and *does* reduce the net-present-value of the rental property. Landlords can respond by taking rental housing off the market (by, for example, becoming owner-occupants or converting properties to a non-controlled type), eviction-through-harassment, or simply by buying out the tenant. Such cases may be easily rectified through appropriate legislation or strengthening tenant protections. 

In this paper, I use data from @chetty2014 to evaluate whether rent control is a viable strategy to preserve neighborhood access to public amenities that increase economic mobility. In other words, rent controls may be welfare-increasing *even if they result in higher rents and lower housing supply overall* if they preserve the access to place-based institutions that allow for mobility.
