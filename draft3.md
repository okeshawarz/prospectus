# Introduction

Regional inequality has become a topic of considerable importance since the
Great Financial Crisis. Much of the recent literature in labor and urban
economics has been on the subject of "superstar cities;" the phenomenon where
the largest cities undergo rapid growth in income and employment, while smaller
ones stagnate and decline.

A major focus of the theoretical and empirical literature has been on the
skill-sorting of cities, with skill-biased technical change driving
in-migration of skilled labor and rising costs driving out-migration of
lower-skilled workers into depressed suburbs and smaller cities. 

The rise of superstar cities has led to a consequent crisis of housing in *all*
cities of the United States, with increases in homelessness and declines in
homeownership and affordability across-the-board, but especially in urban
centers of the most productive city-regions. Inter-city inequality becomes reproduced as intra-city inequality, as land values in cities featuring the most growth becomes prohibitively expensive to own or rent, and zoning for density results in the growth of high-rent housing stock instead of providing for mixed-income neighborhoods. 

Much of the recent literature on the relationship between housing and regional
growth focuses on the elasticity of the housing supply with respect to housing
regulations, particularly zoning. Though the theoretical result is relatively
straightforward (tight housing regulations cause high land rents, leading to
skill sorting), empirical support for this conclusion has been somewhat
ambiguous. Relaxation of the political constraints on zoning may [@hsieh2019]
or may not [@freemark2019] have led to a decrease in the cost of housing. 

I focus on the role that distributive conflict plays in the creation of urban
space and inequality. @rognlie2015 uses NIPA data to show that the decline in
the labor share during the past 30 years seems to be due to an increase in the
share going to housing capital, rather than corporate capital. Similar shifts
in the distribution of income can be seen in breakdowns of GDP by metropolitan
areas. It is also clear that housing prices and rents have risen rapidly over
the same period, in a geographically uneven fashion. The implications of
extreme variances in housing costs are widespread; @chetty2014 and
@derenoncourt show that there are place-based effects to human capital
mobility, and that high housing costs can lock low-income people out of
high-mobility areas.

The mainstream urban economics and inequality literature generally agree that
the housing crisis is largely the result of government failure; zoning laws in
a particular locale are voted on by constituencies containing incumbent
landowners, in whose interest it is to keep growth in the housing stock as low
as possible. Those who would benefit from housing expansion, i.e. potential
emigrants, obviously cannot vote to influence zoning laws in another city. This
leads to low-skilled workers being "trapped" in low-productivity cities that
sort by skill-biased technical change [@ganong2017]. 

Much of this literature relies on the spatial equilibrium approach begun by Von
Thunen, and assume perfectly competitive markets for land, housing and
construction. If this were the case, then divergence between housing prices and
construction costs would be an indication of government failure
[@glaeser2005b]. However, the spatial equilibrium approach has real trouble
dealing with issues of scale; for example, a construction firm equipped to
build in a dense urban region must be considerably more sophisticated and
capital-intensive than a firm building in small outlying towns. 

In addition, @knoll2014 find that  87% of shifts in housing prices in the
United States in the last century can attributed to changes in the price of
land, rather than housing or other land improvements. So it is unclear whether
we can attribute prices in excess of marginal costs solely to regulation or to
other factors, such as monopolization or returns to scale. In this
dissertation, I use a political economy approach to focus on residential real
estate; in particular on distributions between wages, profits, and rents, and
the way that the struggles over that distribution plays out over geographic
space. I intend to use a variety of approaches, including theoretical argument,
historical/descriptive analysis, and econometric analysis.

# On The Housing Question 

**Research Question: What are the conditions under which increases in income are captured by landlords?**

## Introduction

This is a theoretical essay on the distributional role of real estate in the
urban context. I begin with macro data from @rognlie2015, showing that over the
past 30 years, the decline in the labor share can be attributed to increases in
income going to housing, in contravention of Kaldor's stylized facts of growth.
When looking at metropolitan GDP and housing figures, a few results emerge: 

1. The share of of regional GDP going to real estate is increasing, even in
   cities where real estate is not the primary industry

2. Rent-income ratios in the most productive cities have risen rapidly

3. The construction of new housing has experienced a secular decline,
   especially within cities with the fastest income growth

4. The composition of new housing construction has changed, reflecting
   declining homeownership and increased rentership.

In this paper, I build an argument incorporating the critical geography and
Marxist-Georgist urban economics traditions. I develop general theoretical
questions regarding the role of differential rents, economies of scale, and the
level of homeownership, and show that under certain conditions, all of the
income growth in a particular region can be captured by landlords, and that in
equilibrium, urban land markets under conditions of increasing returns may not
clear.

### The Classics

#### Marx & Engels

Marx deals with ground-rent in *Capital, Vol. III*. This is done primarily in
the context of agricultural production, though it forms the basis for the
analysis of urban property ownership by Engels and later geographers and
economists. He begins with the classical political economy premise that "landed
property is based on the monopoly by certain persons over definite portions of
the globe, as exclusive spheres of their private will to the exclusion of all
others." Under capitalist relations, the relationship between the landlord and
the industrial capitalist "...totally separates land an instrument of
production from landed property and landowner-- *for whom the land merely
represents a certain money assessment which he collects by virtue of his
monopoly from the industrial capitalist*, the capitalist farmer..." (emphasis
mine). In other words, land becomes an expression of monetary value, which
represents a claim on the production generated by the capitalist (whether
agrarian or industrial), by virtue of the institution of private property--
ownership of the land represents a *claim* on the *future productivity* of that
land. 

@engels2009 provided the first Marxian analysis of particularly the
*housing* question under urban capitalism, starting from the vantage point
of the English working class. For Engels, "the housing question relates to
problems of quantity (shortage), accessibility/distribution, quality, and
affordability. He argued that the conditions of housing at every time
should be considered as part of, not separate from, broader economic,
social, and political processes," [@obeng-odoom2016]. In other words,
housing dynamics cannot be understood as processes separate from labor
market (and, later, financial market) dynamics.


#### Henry George

While Marx focused on the relationship between Labor and Capital in
relatively land-scarce Europe, Henry George directed his analysis against
the relationship between Labor and Land in the land-abundant United
States. George held that, as against the work of the laborer and the
self-discipline of the capitalist, rent on bare land could increase solely
through public investment into infrastructure and amenities, or through
natural population growth, encouraging rampant land speculation. At the
time, land interests were perceived as holding back the rapid
industrialization of the United States. Mirroring the American
Transcendentalists of his day, he held that land should either be held in
common by all people, as "an endowment from God," [@george2015], or (not
so much like the Transcendentalists), the entire value of bare land should
be taxed away and redistributed by the government. The Land Value Tax
still remains wildly popular among economists as a way to combat land
speculation; while briefly touched on later in this chapter, a full
discussion of the LVT is beyond the scope of this dissertation.
Abstracting from the uniquely American yeoman ethics of *Progress and
Poverty*, the major Georgist theoretical points important to my argument are as
follows:

1. *Private ownership of land grants monopoly power over that plot of
   land, which is part of an absolutely fixed supply.* The somewhat
   bizarre nature of land *vis a vis* other commodities was also noted by
   the other classical economists (especially Ricardo). This grants
   landowners as a class short-side power over any process that requires
   space (e.g., literally every process), and the power to extract rents
   over the use of that land in proportion to how necessary and/or
   valuable that land becomes-- for example, landowners who speculated on
   the future paths of railroad tracks and depots^[or, for a more modern
   example, the purchase of plots of land along the U.S.-Mexico border by
   the founders of Cards Against Humanity, for the purpose of halting
   President Donald Trump's border wall. In fact, this type use of monopoly
   power by landlords was so troublesome to the public good, the power of
   eminent domain was enshrined into the U.S. Constitution under the Fifth
   Amendment. From a kind of Jeffersonian libertarian outlook, this is a rather
   shocking (and telling) violation of the "inviolable" right to
   property.]. This idea remains salient (perhaps even more so) during the
   contemporary period of urban development where economies of scale and
   agglomeration in cities dictate the degree of *locational monopoly*
   a particular landlord is able to exercise.

2. *The value of bare land (i.e., absent any improvements such as
   structures, etc.) is determined by forces outside of any individual
   landowner's control.* In other words, the landlord realizes both
   a capital gain and an increase in potential rent when a location
   becomes desirable, without any action on his or her own part. George
   saw this as something morally abhorrent, but we can also see that
   a raise in rents due to a change in locational advantage is a pure
   redistribution away from other, productive sectors of the economy. 

Further, on point (2): The Henry George Theorem^[in its general form,
[@arnott2004], "in any constrained Pareto optimal and nontrivial
allocation of population in a spatial economy, the aggregate shadow losses
from increasing returns to scale activities just equal the aggregate
shadow profits from the decreasing returns to scale activities."], first formalized by
@arnott1979, is now a staple of public finance. It shows that, under
certain conditions, aggregate spending on public goods will increase
aggregate rent based on land value by at least that amount, thereby
leading to calculations of optimal city sizes, among other things.
Technical discussion of the HGT and its implications are beyond the scope
of this essay, but the salient point I wish to focus on is that the
theorem highlights the *externality* problem facing urban planners and
would-be city dwellers: each landlord's absolute control over their own
personal fiefdom allows them to accrue external benefits from both public
and private actions undertaken outside their property. In modern cities,
with very powerful agglomeration effects, these externalities could grow
to be quite large, as density increases. This potentially points to
increasingly severe coordination failures in housing supply.

In sum, the theoretical lines I wish to draw from Henry George are towards
**the monopoly pricing power over land**, and **positive externalities as a result of
density, scale, and agglomeration.**

## Conclusion and Further areas for study

# The Real Estate State: Housing in the Bay Area

**Research Question: How much of an increase in e.g. regional growth goes to landlords?**

## Introduction

This is a historical/empirical essay that builds on the theoretical arguments
developed in the previous chapter. The historical portion of this chapter
focuses on the political and legislative development of the real estate
industry during the growth of the technology industry starting in the 1990s.
This period can be split into an early period, featuring relatively high
elasticities of housing supply, and a late period, featuring relatively low
elasticity of supply. The empirical methodology builds on @agarwal2019, who
found that increases in the Philadelphia minimum wage had been largely absorbed
into higher rents. I show that, following the argument in the previous chapter,
changes in the (regulatory environment/size of property developers/etc) in the
late period caused the same to be true for *general* increases in income (in
other words; high productivity in spatially-concentrated industry turned higher
wages into transfer payments from employers to landlords).

## A History of Bay Area Real Estate

[Neighborhood development before and after GFC, including major court cases,
major developments, tenant/owner fights, something similar to ]

## Data and Methodology

Bay Area cities should have relatively well-established data on land prices and
rents. I need to think of a specification to show what happens to rents when
the average (median) income of a neighborhood increases, to control for
increased demand and migration. If I had the *perfect* data set, it would
include:

* Median incomes for renters in a particular location,

* Rents for those particular locations

* Housing units, owner-occupied vs. rented over the time period

* Number of building permits issued in the location

I should be able to similarly use a DID approach. Where @agarwal2019 used
lease-agreements as a proxy for minimum wage-earners' budget constraints,
I would have to find a different dependent variable. The equation to be
estimated would be something like:

$$ \Delta rent_i = \Beta_1 \Delta medianwage_i + \gamma controls $$

Where I could compare those neighborhoods/metro areas that had the features
identified in chapter 1 to those that did not.

# Rent Control, Neighborhood Stability, and Economic Mobility

**Research Question: Does rent control actually prevent neighborhood displacement? OR Does rent control preserve economic mobility?**

## Introduction

One need only to mention the phrase "rent control" to an economist to hear the
reflexive Lindbeck quote about aerial bombardment, accompanied by a radioactive
level of smugness. Rent control is considered as solved a problem as any, with
the consensus of the entire discipline holding that rent control is as wasteful
as any price control, resulting the lower housing quality, housing shortages,
and paradoxically higher rents (e.g. @diamond2018). Yet, despite this, in the
face of spiralling housing costs in many of the metro areas of the USA, many
municipalities are calling for (and enacting) rent control legislation. 

In a distributive-conflict framework, residential rent is a payment that
a landlord extracts from a tenant through the threat of displacement via
eviction. Rent control provides a check on this ability, and *does* reduce the
net-present-value of the rental property. Landlords can respond by taking
rental housing off the market (by, for example, becoming owner-occupants or
converting properties to a non-controlled type), eviction-through-harassment,
or simply by buying out the tenant. Such cases may be easily rectified through
appropriate legislation or strengthening tenant protections. 

In this paper, I use data from @chetty2014 to evaluate whether rent control is
a viable strategy to preserve neighborhood access to public amenities that
increase economic mobility. In other words, rent controls may be
welfare-increasing *even if they result in higher rents and lower housing
supply overall* if they preserve the access to place-based institutions that
allow for mobility.
