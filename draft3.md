# Introduction

# The Housing Question 

## Introduction

This is a theoretical essay on the distributional role of real estate in the urban context. I begin with macro data from @rognlie2015, showing that over the past 30 years, the decline in the labor share can be attributed to increases in income going to housing, in contravention of Kaldor's stylized facts of growth. When looking at metropolitan GDP and housing figures, a few results emerge: 

1. The share of of regional GDP going to real estate is increasing, even in cities where real estate is not the primary industry

2. Rent-income ratios in the most productive cities have risen rapidly

3. The construction of new housing has experienced a secular decline, especially within cities with the fastest income growth

4. The composition of new housing construction has changed, reflecting declining homeownership and increased rentership.

In this paper, I build an argument incorporating the critical geography and Marxist-Georgist urban economics traditions. I develop general theoretical questions regarding the role of differential rents, economies of scale, and the level of homeownership, and show that under certain conditions, all of the income growth in a particular region can be captured by landlords, and that in equilibrium, urban land markets under conditions of increasing returns may not clear. 

This contributes to the urban economics literature by giving a theoretical justification for intervention into housing markets, and points to a policy implication that is neither NIMBY nor YIMBY, but something more nuanced.

## Introduction

This is a historical/empirical essay that builds on the theoretical arguments developed in the previous chapter. The historical portion of this chapter focuses on the political and legislative development of the real estate industry during the growth of the technology industry starting in the 1990s. This period can be split into an early period, featuring relatively high elasticities of housing supply, and a late period, featuring relatively low elasticity of supply. The empirical methodology builds on @agarwal2019, who found that increases in the Philadelphia minimum wage had been largely absorbed into higher rents. I show that, following the argument in the previous chapter, changes in the (regulatory environment/size of property developers/etc) in the late period caused the same to be true for *general* increases in income (in other words; high productivity in spatially-concentrated industry turned higher wages into transfer payments from employers to landlords).

## A History of Bay Area Real Estate

[Neighborhood development before and after GFC, including major court cases, major developments, tenant/owner fights]

## Data and Methodology

Bay Area cities should have relatively well-established data on land prices and rents. I need to think of a specification to show what happens to rents when the average (median) income of a neighborhood increases, to control for increased demand and migration.

## Results and Conclusion

# Rent Control, Neighborhood Stability, and Economic Mobility
