abstract: This prospectus poses three questions in the field of urban political economy. The first is a theoretical question on the relationship between urban growth, density, wages, profits, and rents, based on classical political economy treatments of the land question. The second is a historical-descriptive question that attempts to apply the theoretical insights of the first chapter to the recent burst of growth and subsequent crisis of housing in San Francisco, California. The final question is an empirical study on the impacts of rent control laws in the United States.

# Introduction: Centering Space in Political Economy

This prospectus outlines a proposal for three essays on the themes of urban
growth, distribution, rents, and housing policy in the United States. The
overall motivation of this dissertation, in the broadest terms, is to
understand how markets for land and housing (and their associated rents)
affect economic outcomes for those living and working in cities. Over the
course of evaluating this question, this dissertation will touch upon
questions of income and wealth inequality, agglomeration economies, growth
theory, and housing policy.

The discipline of Economics has been going through something of its own
"spatial turn," lagging somewhat embarassingly behind most of the other
social sciences. It has become increasingly obvious that heterogeneity of
outcomes across space, as well as time, is key to understanding crucial
economic phenomena. In the past few years much has been made about "superstar
cities," "superstar firms," and other high-powered agents within the American
economy that seem to have distinct economic centers of gravity. At the same
time, housing crises are being proclaimed in the most prosperous of American
cities while others are still mired in stagnation and decay. The *spatiality* of
American economic life is finally getting its own as problems of growth and
decline are recognized as fundamentally place-linked. This dissertation is a
contribution to the spatialization of economics. 

@soja1980 conceived of a socio-spatial dialectic, where social relations
shape spatial relations, which are in turn shaped by them. This shows up as an
unevenness of social relations across space and scale, as people and production
shift from rural to urban to suburban and back again, with concomitant shifts in
social practice, political culture, and economic inequality. The tradition of
radical geography, starting with @lefebvre2003, has always fundamentally been
about the right to the city-- for whom does the city work for, and to whom does
it belong? And further, for Soja, one of the key questions was "how do patterns
of land ownership determine the right to the city?" It is broadly this question
that my dissertation hopes to engage with. In fact, the essays outlined in this
proposal are concerned with a proper subset of spatial relations, though perhaps
the most obvious ones: land ownership and rents.  

Land and land-rents, of course, have not always been relegated to the periphery
of the economics discipline; it, and the problem of landed property, was a
primary concern of the classical political economists. In *The Wealth of
Nations*, Adam Smith writes:

>Ground-rents, so far as they exceed the ordinary rent of land, are altogether
>owing to the good government of the sovereign, which, by protecting the
>industry of either the whole people, or of the inhabitants of some particular
>place, enables them to pay so much more than its real value for the ground
>which they build their houses upon... Nothing can be more reasonable than that
>a fund, which owes its existence to the good government of the state should be
>taxed peculiarly, or should contribute something more than the greater part of
>other funds, towards the support of that government. 

The peculiarity of the institution of land-ownership was well-known to the
classics, Smith, Ricardo, and Marx. The existence of a monopoly on *space*,
which is something of a fundamental condition of existence posed huge
barriers to the well-organized accumulation of capital (Ricardo, for example,
famously argued for the abolition of the Corn Laws, leading to the
liquidation of the English landlords as a class). The tripartite division of
the national product into wages, profits, and rents was a relatively
uncontroversial tenet of political economy until John Bates Clark's marginal
productivity theory, lacking any theory of land or land-rent, became the
groundwork for the neoclassical school of economics. This precise bit of
history of economic thought will be elaborated on further in Essay 1, but I
mention it here because it informs the necessity of the contribution of this
dissertation. 

After land disappeared from the production function, it returned to the general
equilibrium model through the work of Von Thunen [@harvey1981], who incorporated
the ideas of distance and transportation costs. This later turned into the
location theory of Hotelling, and the workhorse spatial equilibrium that is now
standard in urban economic theory. In this model, markets (particularly for
housing) are considered perfectly competitive, and workers and firms choose a
location in equilibrium such that neither can be made better off by moving to a
different location (hence the vigorous debate by authors such as @byrne2002 over
whether gentrification is Good Actually). Neither space nor land have any
existence in this view; they both merely reduce to *distance*, which appears
merely as a transportation cost-- the "annihilation of space by time" @marx2005
in a very real sense. There are no neighborhoods here (and hence, no reason to
speak of neighborhood stability), and there are no landowners-- merely owners of
a particular capital good that earn a return equal to that good's contribution
to production. It is here that my dissertation proposes to make an intervention;
this view misses a few very key points about urban economic processes because it
is 1) aspatial, and 2) ahistorical. 

I say that it is aspatial because space, to the extent that land appears, it is
merely as a cost rather than a social relation. Specifically, ownership of land
conveys a monopoly right of exclusion (within limits, of course, but these
limits are *politically* determined). Land ownership also confers benefits
wholly dependent on the social activity occurring on or around it, with the idea
of the "marginal contribution" of land making little sense outside of the
context of spatial relations (this was one of Henry George's key insights). I
say that it is ahistorical because returns to scale and returns to agglomeration
are clearly central phenomena in the existence of cities, and the existence of
these mean a high sensitivity to initial conditions and perhaps even divergence
as a generalized phenomenon^[I will note here that a separate literature on spatial relations in economics
became prominent in the 80s, called "New Economic Geography" [@krugman2011a].
This was an attempt to model increasing returns by cribbing North-South models
of trade.]

The rapid shift in the spatial awareness, so to speak, of economics, has become
such that @proost2019, very firmly in the neoclassical camp, begin themselves to
sound like the radical geographers:

> Space is the substratum of human affairs, but  it  is  also  a  consumption
> and  production  good  in  the  form  of  land.  The  worldwide  supply of
> land is perfectly inelastic but vastly exceeds  the  demand  for  it.
> Therefore,  putting  aside  the  agricultural  land  rent,  the  price  of
> land  should  be  zero.  Yet,  housing  costs may be very high and vary
> enormously with  the  size  and  composition  of  cities  for  reasons  that
> do  not  depend  on  the  quality  of  the  housing  structure.

It is precisely this relationship, between the geographic unevenness of the
scale of human activity (i.e., the agglomeration of cities), the price of land
and its associated necessity for any human activity, including production of
commodities and the re-production of the labor force, that this dissertation
will investigate. In the body of this prospectus, I will outline my plan for
further research on the role of land and rents in urban economics. In the
first essay, I will develop a theoretical framework based on classical
formulations of the land and housing questions to investigate the
relationship between urban growth, land rents, and wages. I will begin by
developing the concept of urban space as theorized by the radical geography
tradition and relating it to the classical political economy thought
surrounding land and land rents, beginning with Adam Smith. I intend to
demonstrate the ways in which the urban (productive) capitalist sector
interact with workers and landlords in order to produce a given spatial
structure, spatial hierarchy, and income distribution. This will consist of
both a review of the history of economic thought on land rents and a
theoretical argument regarding the role of urban growth on rents and wages.

In the next essay, I intend to apply the theoretical framework developed in the
first essay to the case of urban growth in San Francisco. The city has several
features that make it an interesting case study. First, it has rapidly
transitioned to the type of urban economy that I propose drive many of the
effects discussed in the previous section-- namely, one with a primary sector
characterized by large agglomeration economies. Second, the city's (and the
state of California's generally) political economy is influenced by a relatively
powerful political class of landlords and developers. Third, the city exhibits
physical limits to sprawl (in the form of the Pacific Ocean) and also varying
levels of political constraints to expansion by the aforementioned landowning
class. Thus, it is a useful case study to explore the way distributional
conflict occurs across urban space. The essay will take a historical approach,
outlining in broad strokes the evolution of land prices, wages and rents since
WWII, and examining in particular detail the most recent period of expansion
since 2012 and its associated housing crisis. The essay will rely on descriptive
data on wages, profits, rents, housing construction,  evictions provided by the
Census Bureau, HUD, and the City of San Francisco, archival data on housing
developments and public construction, and data on housing and rents scraped from
the Internet.

The final essay is an empirical investigation into one of the policies that
municipalities may use to control rent growth and hence alter the
distribution of income: rent control. Though the consensus of economists is
tilted heavily against rent control as an appropriate mechanism for the
promotion of housing affordability, empirical evidence for the proposed
negative effects of rent control has been mixed. This essay, then, represents
a contribution to the somewhat scant empirical literature on rent control in
the United States. Using either restricted-use data from the Census Bureau's
Rental Housing Finance survey or publicly available data on housing from the
American Community Survey, this essay uses a quasi-experimental research
design that designates either households qualifying for rent control or
municipalities enacting rent control as the treatment group and compares them
to a geographically-adjacent control region that did not enact rent control,
following @dube2010. This essay is intended to causally identify the impacts of
rent control on the housing supply, rental supply, and neighborhood stability.
This essay is intended to provide more evidence on the debate over the
appropriate policy to take in order to maintain housing affordability in U.S.
cities.

Taken together, these three essays represent a contribution to the
understanding the function of landownership and land rents in influencing the
distribution of incomes in advanced economies generally, with implications
for the study of income and wealth inequality, spatial patterns of growth and
decline, and housing and urban policy.

# What do Landlords Do? The Political Economy of Urban Growth and Distribution

## Abstract

This chapter is about urban growth. Who wins when a city grows? Who benefits
from economies of scale and economies of agglomeration? In particular, how is
the distribution of urban economic growth affected by the distribution of and
control over land (and housing)? How are these distributional decisions made
and implemented? In this essay, I present a theoretical account of the way
that cities grow, and the way that this growth is divided between wages,
profits, and rents. The particularly urban features of agglomeration feature
heavily into this account. I begin with the observation that neoclassical
treatments of urban growth have, since John Bates Clark, left out land as a
particular factor of production. Without accounting for the role of
landlords, any account of the role of rents in urban growth (which is likely
to quite large) will likely be insufficient. I follow this with a
presentation of the classical political economy thought on land rents and
growth, followed by a formal presentation of a broadly Marxian-Georgist
account of growth and distribution in an urban economy.

## Research Questions

1. To what extent are gains from public goods and productivity increases
   captured by landlords?

2. How do the peculiarities of urban growth (agglomeration, long-lived
   structures) affect the distributions of wages, profits and rents?

3. What is the relationship between wages, profits, and rents in an urban
   economy? What are the structural features of this relationship, and what
   drives their variation across cities?

This essay is motivated by a deceptively simple question: When cities grow,
do rents rise or do they fall? The simple Economics 101 answer is that of
course, when more space is brought into the urban system (by, e.g., expanding
the supply of housing through either new construction or upzoning existing
neighborhoods for greater density), then rents should *ceteris paribus* fall.

Of course, *ceteris* is never *paribus*, and the most confounding feature comes
from the nature of cities themselves: they are an increasing-returns phenomenon,
and the expansion of a city itself may be a function of the desirability and
productivity of that city. In other words, when a city grows, the expansion of
the housing supply may not result in a decrease in rents.

As mentioned in the introduction to this proposal, questions regarding land
and land rents were central to the questions of economics for centuries prior
to the marginal revolution, before being relegated to the comparatively small
subfields of Urban and Real Estate Economics. In recent years, the
recognition of geographic inequalities across and within cities and regions
have brought attention back to the role that geographic space, in the
somewhat truncated forms of "distance" and "place." Meanwhile, the fields of
Geography, Urban Planning, and Sociology, among others, continued to grapple
with the issues of land rents and spatial structure and hierarchy in the
interregnum, most notably in the radical urban geography tradition begun by
Lefebvre and the discipline of urban sociology pioneered at the University of
Chicago.

This essay is an attempt to engage some of the insights of classical economic
thought on land and land-rents in answering modern economic questions of
growth and distribution; although the study of landlords and rents was
central to the focus of political economy, the study of housing rents and
urban real estate is conspicuously absent. I intend to incorporate some of
the contributions of radical geography, particularly notions of *space*,
*spatiality,* and spatial hierarchies.* It is important to note here that I
will largely be talking about *land*, which is only a subset of *spatial
relations* that comprise urban geographies. It is also important to note here
that although much of the discussion in this chapter will center around
housing costs in the form of residential rents, the focus of this chapter is
on land rents and land ownership more generally, rather than on the
particular problem of high housing costs. This last feature is an important
element of my critique of some of the modern theoretical literature on urban
growth, which I expand upon further in that respective section. The essay
will be structured as follows: First, I discuss the role of land rents and
urban structure in classical accounts of growth and distribution, paying
particular attention to Karl Marx and Henry George. The essential focus here
will be to adapt the classical thought on rents and landlords to questions
surrounding the dynamics of modern urban land and housing prices
(essentially: how do urban agglomerative effects interact with rents?). After
that, I will develop these into a formal theoretical presentation.

## Literature Review

Much of the recent urban economics literature on growth has focused on two
things: human capital theories of urban growth (including skill-biased technical
change and sorting) and the effects of housing-supply constraints. All of these
rely broadly on spatial equilibrium models and "spatial mismatch" explanations--
in other words, some factor is preventing labor and investment from being
directed to its most efficient location.

@moretti2013 begins with observations on the vast inter-city inequalities that
had begun to emerge at the turn of the millennium. He identifies significant and
persistent heterogeneity in American economic geography, but points out that
only recently has the heterogeneity been driven by high rates of human capital
(as measured by college degree attainment) in so-called skilled cities. His
theory of urban agglomeration is centered around knowledge spillovers; a
consequence of this is that if the gains to knowledge spillovers are high, then
a city with a "small-firm" ecosystem will tend to do better, pay higher wages,
and grow more, than a city with a "large-firm" ecosystem. However, growth in
productivity will, absent growth in the housing stock, will tend to drive up
rents, leading to declines in inter-city mobility and a skill-sorting
equilibrium where human capital is drained out of declining cities. Indeed,
@ganong2017 has found that both income divergence and migration between cities
has declined since the 90s, and @giannone2017 fits Census data to a structural
spatial equilibrium model to show that skill-biased technical change explains in
part the decline in regional income convergence-- in essence low-skilled workers
become "trapped" in low-skilled cities. @hsieh2019 estimates the
effects of housing restrictions on inter-city mobility and finds that they
reduced aggergate U.S. growth by 50% over the period 1964-2009.

In their 2002 paper, Glaeser and Gyourko use the divergence between housing
prices and construction costs to show that prices in certain markets are much
higher than they "should" be. Under the perfect-competition assumptions of
the spatial equilibrium model, this is perfectly valid; any distortions such
that prices do not equal marginal costs should be the result of market
failure or government intervention. However, it is not clear to me that the
construction industry can be called perfectly competitive, especially in
densely-built urban sectors.

The few empirical papers that have been done on the topic of land rents have
found mixed results. @freemark2019 finds no evidence that supply-side
policies (in particular, zoning for greater density in Chicago) do not
necessarily result in the reduction of rents or the expansion of the housing
stock (let alone the expansion of the supply of *affordable* housing).
Finally, the effects identified by @agarwal2019 are precisely the phenomenon
that this essay wishes to investigate: they find that 5 years after an
increase in the minimum wage in 25 states, rent increases had absorbed almost
the entirety of the increased income.

Finally, Knoll et. al also find that 87% of housing price shifts in the United
States during the last century can be attributed to changes in the price of
land. So it is again unclear whether we can attribute prices in excess of
marginal costs solely to regulation or something else. Here the spatial
equilibrium approach is particularly poorly-suited to deal with the question of
land, treating returns to land the same as capital income. Thus, I propose a
re-spatialization of economics, using the classical approach with land as a
separate factor of production as a base.

### Classical Views of Rent

Land rents emerged as a chief concern for the early study of political economy,
though largely in the realm of agricultural production.
@ricardo1821 began with the assumption that the quantity of land available for
cultivation was fixed, and therefore itself had no price of production. He
observed that land of different fertility levels produced different levels of
output, and the most fertile land was generally the most limited in supply.
Consider three plots of land $n_1,$ $n_2$, and $n_3$. Each $i$ plot yields,
given identical inputs of labor and capital, an output of corn $x_1<x_2<x_3$.
Each plot is owned by a landowner, who is paid a *rent* by a (capitalist)
farmer, who then pays a wage $w$, and faces a market price of $p$. The profit
earned on the marginal ("rent-free") land is then $r_1 = x_1p-w$. It is easy to
see that a farmer on the worst plot of land would pay up to $r_2-r_1$ as rent to
the landlord in order to earn $r_2$. This forms the basis of *Ricardian rent--*
any surplus generated by land that is more productive than the marginal piece of
land is captured by the landlord. Ricardo used this as the basis of his argument
against the Corn Laws; as population (and the demand for food) increased, worse
and worse marginal land would be brought into cultivation, causing differential
rents to increase and profits to fall, choking out investment. The solution, in
abolishing the Corn Laws, was to essentially re-locate the most marginal land
under cultivation to any farmland in the world.

Marx's discussion of ground-rent is spread throughout *Capital Vols. II,
III*, and *Theories of Surplus Value.* Following Ricardo, Marx also deals
primarily with the case of rents in agriculture and mining, paid to a class
of landlords by a class of capitalists. We can make use of @resnick1989's
framework here and think of the insitution of land ownership as a *subsumed
class process*, where the surplus value generated by the productive sector is
then distributed to the landlord class as a condition for the existence of
the *fundamental class process* (i.e., the direct extraction of surplus
value). Marx begins with the premise that "landed property is based on the
monopoly by certain persons over definite portions of the globe, as exclusive
spheres of their private will to the exclusion of all others." Under
capitalist relations, the relationship between the landlord and the
industrial capitalist "... totally separates land as an instrument of
production from landed property and landowner-- *for whom the land merely
represents a certain money assessment which he collects by virtue of his
monopoly from the industrial capitalist*, the capitalist farmer..." (emphasis
added). In other words, land becomes an expression of monetary value, which
represents a claim on the production generated by the capitalist by virtue of
the institution of private property. In other words, ownership of the land
represents a *claim* on *future productivity* of that land. @basu2018
remarks: "Under capitalist relations of production... limited quantity and
private ownership of the non-produced resource come together to create
impediments to the free movement to capital into [the sector taking the
non-produced resource as an input]. That creates the basis for the emergence
of rent^[this formulation may have some interesting extensions into the
production process for commodities whose reproduction costs are essentially
zero, for example software.].

In addition to Ricardian differential rent as noted above, Marx added to this
notion a second form of differential rent that emerged from different quantities
of capital invested on different plots of land, and in addition to this, the
notion of *absolute rent:*

>Assuming then that demand requires the taking up of new land which is,
>say,less fertile than that previously cultivated, will the owner of this land
>lease it for nothing just because the market price of its product has risen
>high enough for capital investment to pay the farmer the price of production
>and thus yield him the customary profit? In no way. The capital investment
>must yield him a rent.He leases only when a lease-price can be paid. @marx1991

Absolute rent represents the distribution of surplus value to the subsumed
class process. Since landowners have monopoly control over the disposal of
their property, landlords can capture enough surplus from the capitalist as
rent, such that the capitalist is forced to earn the average economy-wide
rate of profit. Following Basu, we begin with a definition of surplus profit
in agriculture on the $i$th plot of land and economy-wide average profit $\alpha$:

$$SP_i = (c_i + v_i)r_i - (c_i + v_i)\alpha,$$

$$DRI_i=(c_i+v_i)(r_i-r_1)$$

$$DRII_i=[(c_i+v_i)-(c_1+v_1)](r_1-\alpha)$$

$$AR=(c_1+v_1)(r-\alpha),$$

where total ground-rent becomes

$$GR_i=DRI_i+DRII_i+AR_i= (c_i+v_i)r_i-(c_i+v_i)\alpha = (c_i+v_i)(r_i-\alpha).$$

Thus, the absolute rent on a particular plot of land is related to the
rate of profit on the individual plot of land and the economy-wide rate of
profit. It is important here to note three points: Marx and Ricardo both
analyzed agricultural production, with differential rents arising from
different levels of fertility. They both mention "locational advantage" as
other forms of differential productivity, but what this means and how it
works was not elucidated. Second, this section deals primarily with land
as a direct input into production, i.e., as *commercial* real estate.
Neither Marx nor Ricardo deal with *residential* real estate, which does
not enter directly into the production of commodities, but indirectly as
an input to the production of *labor-power.* In this case, private
landownership still functions as a subsumed class process, a necessary
condition of existence for capitalist production, but the relationship
between *wages* and ground-rents are not discussed-- in this formulation,
rents simply appear as a transfer from the capitalist class to the
landowning class, and the existence of a private market in land existed
fundamentally as a barrier to the accumulation of *capital,* rather than
as a source of declining living-standards for the worker^[This was a point
brought up by @lenin1907 in his criticism of the Narodniks: "The Narodnik
thinks that repudiation of private landownership is repudiation of
capitalism. That is wrong. The repudiation of private landownership
expresses the demands for the purest capitalist development. And we have
to revive in the minds of Marxists the, “forgotten words” of Marx, who
criticised private landownership from the point of view of the conditions
of capitalist economy...Consequently, the abolition of private
landownership is the maximum that can be done in bourgeois society for the
removal of all obstacles to the free investment of capital in agriculture
and to the free flow of capital from one branch of production to another.
The free, wide, and rapid development of capitalism, complete freedom for
the class struggle, the disappearance of all superfluous intermediaries
who make. agriculture something like the “sweated” industries—that is what
nationalisation of the land implies under the capitalist system of
production."] Finally, the mechanism for the extraction of absolute rent
is not clearly defined-- can landlords really bargain away *the entirety*
of superprofits in agriculture? What are the constraints on this process?
How does it operate in the context of *urban* real estate?

**add a better section on Engels here**

While Marx focused on the relationship between labor and capital in relatively
land-scarce Europe, Henry George directed his analysis on the relationship
between labor and land in the land-abundant United States. At the time, land
interests were perceived as holding back the rapid industrialization of the
United States. Mirroring the American Transcendentalists of his day, he held
that land should either be held in common by all people, as "an endowment from
God," [@george2015], or the entire value of bare land should be taxed away and
used for public investment.

George was among the first to write about land rents in an explicitly urban
context, in which both economies of scale and agglomeration play a role. The
first arises, remarks @whitaker2001, from an increase in scope of the potential
division of labor that comes with a general increase in population:

>increased population,of itself, and without any advance in the arts, implies
>an increase in the productive power of labor... with every additional pair of
>hands which increasing population brings, there is a more than proportionate
>addition to the productive power of labor. [@george2015]

Whereas this scale affect arises simply from an increase in population, George
also focuses on agglomeration effects that arise from the concentration of
people in a specific, i.e., urban, area:

>for the increased powers of co-operation and exchange which come with
>increased >population are equivalent to-- nay, I think we can say without
>metaphor, that they give an increased capacity to land. rings out a superior
>power in labor, which is localized on land—- which attaches not to labor
>generally, but only to labor exerted on particular land; and which thus
>inheres in the land as much as any qualities of soil, climate, mineral
>deposit, or natural situation, and passes, as they do, with the possession of
>the land...

In other words, the specialization that is afforded to production on a specific
piece of dense urban land itself increases the productivity of that land in much
the same way as a difference in natural fertility in the Ricardian story. And,
as in the Ricardian story, the difference between the current "productivity" of
the land and the surplus on the no-rent margin can be captured by landlords as
differential rents. Thus, any action that increases the concentration of
population in a particular urban space also increased the productivity of that
space (what can we say about the "productivity" of a particular space?), but
because of the nature of private land ownership, any gains to that
productivity are captured by landlords; an additional worker that moves to
an urban agglomeration has *external effects* on the productivity of other
workers for which he or she is not compensated for by an increase in the
wage, *and* that these gains are a pure redistribution away from the
productive sector of the economy^[Marxist accounts of this, e.g.
@harvey1974, point out that this need not be entirely redistributive;
capitalist land markets do have an efficiency-enhancing function by
directing production to its most *locationally* profitable use]. 

It seems somewhat unreasonable that landlords are able to obtain the
*entire* surplus, in a sort of Ultimatum Game equilibrium-- obviously
workers are (sometimes!) made better off when productivity increases, and
firms are able to make profit over and above the amount paid to rent.
Likewise, rather than a new feudal class rising up and snuffing out
corporate capital and impoverished workers, the gains to landed property
ebb and flow, high in some areas and lower in others. If, as in the
question of wages, the rent payment is determined by relative bargaining
power, then what are the parameters of the bargaining problem? What
strengthens land against labor and land against capital? At what point do
their incentives align? These are questions that this essay intends to
investigate. 

The Henry George Theorem^[in its general form (Arnott 2004): "in any
constrained Pareto optimal and nontrivial allocation of population in
a spatial economy, the aggregate shadow losses from increasing returns to
scale activities just equal the aggregate shadow profits from the
decreasing returns to scale activities."], first formalized by
@arnott1979, is now a staple of public finance. It shows that, under
certain conditions, aggregate spending on public goods will increase
aggregate rent based on land value by at least that amount, thereby
leading to calculations of optimal city sizes, among other things.
Technical discussion of the HGT and its implications are beyond the scope
of this essay, but the salient point I wish to focus on is that the
theorem highlights the _externality_ problem facing urban planners and
would-be city dwellers: each landlord's absolute control over their own
personal fiefdom allows them to accrue external benefits from both public
*and private actions* undertaken outside their property; for George the
idea really was that *any* locationally-specific increase in productivity
would we bargained away into land rents. Again, the question arises-- what
are the parameters of this value capture? George was limited by his
analysis of the relationship between labor and capital-- for him, the
ratio of wages to profits remained constant, and they both rose and fell
in the same proportion in the face of rising or falling rents. One of the
questions this dissertation intends to address is, if land rents are the
result of distributional conflict between land and labor, how does this
affect (and is affected by) the distributional conflict between labor and
capital^[Marx famously commented harshly on the Georgist Single Tax
Movement, writing in a letter to Friedrich Sorge "All these “socialists”
since Colins have this much in common that they leave wage labour and
therefore capitalist production in existence and try to bamboozle
themselves or the world into believing that if ground rent were
transformed into a state tax all the evils of capitalist production would
disappear of themselves. The whole thing is therefore simply an attempt,
decked out with socialism, to save capitalist domination and indeed to
establish it afresh on an even wider basis than its present one."]?

In George's own words:

>To recapitulate: The effect of increasing population upon the distribution of
>wealth is to increase rent, and consequently to diminish the proportion of the

## Methodology and Conclusion

In this essay, I intend to proceed as follows: I begin with a more comprehensive
review of the contemporary literature in urban economics, as a jump-off point to
the issues of urbanization, housing, and rents. I then focus on a detailed
history of economic thought on the topics of land rents and urbanization,
focusing primarily on the thinking of Marx and George, along with the respective
literatures that they began. Finally, I condense this into a classical
presentation of a theoretical relationship between wages, profits, rents, and
urbanization. The intent of this essay is summed up by the following conjecture:

Cities are, by nature, an increasing-returns phenomenon. In light of that
fact, when cities become more dense, it may be the case that the productivity
of cities increases, leading to higher relocations of firms, and greater
demand for land and housing within the city. Given the peculiar nature of the
land commodity, this has implications for many feature of urban growth. For
example, if increased density increases the amount captured by landlords, in
other words, increases rents, then the market urbanist prescription of simply
upzoning and constructing more market-rate housing may result in an increase
in housing supply without any decrease in rents. Additionally, the long-lived
nature of the housing commodity, and the increasing costs of building to density
mean that out-of-equilibrium dynamics of urban economies become highly
important. It doesn't seem likely that, even if we grant the assumptions of the
canonical spatial equilibrium model, that land and housing markets adjust as
quickly as labor markets do, especially in the case of an urban *decline*-- the
Rust Belt is evidence of cities that were once highly productive, with
relatively high wages, and now have land and housing once highly valuable but
are now no longer so.

# On Growth and Housing in San Francisco

## Research Questions

1. What are the structural features of the historical periods of expansion in
   San Francisco during the Post-WWII Era?

2. How did these economic expansions show up in the distribution of wages, profits, and rents?

3. From the perspective of growth in rents and the housing crisis, is the most
   recent period different of expansion different than previous eras? If so,
   what are the features driving the difference?

## Abstract

This chapter applies the theoretical insights from the previous chapter into a
historical-discriptive account of the growth and development of the city of San
Francisco. In many ways, it is a story about the structural transformation of
the technology economy, and how its rapid growth affected the demographic and
incomes of the population on the one hand, and housing costs and urban structure
on the other hand.

# Introduction

How do patterns of land ownership determine the Right to the City? for
@soja2000, this  was perhaps one of the fundamental practical questions for
thinking about the relationship between the social and the spatial. The
historical phases of business cycles, crises, labor and capital movements all
imprint themselves quite literally in the structures of the built environment.
All of these historical phenomena affected and were affected by the development
of urban cityspace (in both the sense of urban social relations in general and
of the specific cases of particular cities), creating a sort of urban
archaeology-- layers of bones and sinew upon which successive generations of
spatial structures were built. 

Soja uses the term *synekism* to refer to the "stimulus of urban agglomeration:" 

# Rent Control Revisited: Is it Good, Actually?

1. To what extent is new housing construction affected by the implementation of
   rent controls?

2. To what extent is the supply of *rental housing* affected by the
   implementation of rent controls?

3. To what extent do rent controls accomplish the goals of maintaining housing
   affordability and neighborhood stability?

## Abstract

This essay is a contribution to the empirical literature on rent control in
the United States. Despite re-invigorated demands for rent control policies
globally, the consensus of the economics discipline has remained solidly
against the measure. Most of this opposition is on theoretical grounds,
rather than empirical evidence. How severe are the deleterious effects of
rent control on the housing supply, rents, and neighborhood composition? Does
it really achieve the desired goal of neighborhood stabilization, or does it
merely increase the rate of gentrification and housing cost growth? This essay
addresses the difficulty of well-identified empirical work on housing in
general, and estimates the impacts of municipal rent control policies on rents,
tenure lengths, neighborhood amenity access, the rate of new housing
construction, and the supply of rental housing.

## Introduction

Rent control is considered as solved a problem as any in economics, with the
consensus of the vast majority of the economics discipline being that the policy
is a textbook case of unintended consequences. Rent control is, of course a
price control, and the consensus view is that it results in social waste, lower
housing quality, housing shortages, and paradoxically higher rents. Despite
this, in the face of spiralling housing costs in many of the metro areas of the
USA, many state and local governments are calling for (and enacting) rent
control regulation.

Similar to academic consensus on the minimum wage debates prior to the 1990s
empirical labor literature, the negative view of economists on rent control
is widespread despite empirical evidence being mixed, at best-- much of the
existing literature struggles with external validity and limited-scope
problems. This chapter serves as in empirical intervention into the rent
control debate. Taking a cue from the minimum wage literature, this paper
intends to estimate the comparative impacts of rent control policies on the
variables of interest-- namely, growth in the housing stock, growth in the
supply of rental housing, home prices, rents, and neighborhood stability. In
addition, following the literature on public goods, this essay seeks to
examine the second-order benefits that rent control may provide by providing
access to the institutions and amenities that promote inter-generational
mobility to those households that would have otherwise been displaced by rising
housing costs.

## Literature Review

@pastor2018 provides a general overview of the recent empirical literature
on rent control. They find that the literature is relatively
straightforward on the effect of rent control on rents-- that is, rent
control reduces rents for rent-regulated housing units. They also find the
evidence to be much more lukewarm than the theory on the supposed
destructiveness of rent regulation. 

@gilderbloom2007 estimates the impacts of second-generation rent controls on a
cross-section of New Jersey cities. The authors assert that New Jersey has a
"moderate" form of rent control allowing for guaranteed rent increases every
year, with some cities including a vacancy decontrol provision. They use data
from a survey by the New Jersey Tenants Organization at the city level of
observation, and tested using OLS. They found that "moderate rent control had no
significant impact on median monthly contract rent." They also found evidence
that rent controls *increased* the supply of rental housing by incentivizing
landlords to subdivide their rental units. Overall, the total effect on the
housing supply and maintenance of the housing stock was relatively minor. 

@ambrosius2015 replicates the results of @gilderbloom2007, and adds an
additional decade to the analysis. They find, as before that the impact of rent
controls in New Jersey had negligible effect on the housing supply, and suggest
that the relatively generous provisions of the laws combined with widespread
vacancy decontrol meant that the rent controls were rarely binding. These two
analyses have the benefit of being relatively more general than single-city case
studies; they both have drawbacks in that the methodology used does not lead to
causal identification. Taken together, both these studies take two points in
time and show that there has been little statistical divergence in the outcome
variables-- whether that is due to the non-bindingness of rent controls or to
some other hidden effect is not clear. 

@diamond2018 provides the most recent well-identified empirical analysis of rent
control, and is the most similar in methodology and substance to this essay.
They use private data sets from DataQuick and Infutor. The combined datasets
allowed the authors to link the identity of any resident of San Francisco to a
particular address during the period 1990-2016, in order to distinguish between
owner-occupied and rental housing. They combine this with zipcode-level
estimates on rents, imputed from housing price transaction data. In essence,
they estimate a linear relationship between median rents in a zipcode and the
sale price of housing in that zip code. They use this combined dataset to
estimate tenant, landlord, and parcel-level effects of a ballot initiative that
suddenly brought a significant number of multi-family dwellings under the rent
control law. They also estimate welfare effects in a general equilibrium
framework using a structural spatial equilibrium model of the type detailed in
section 2.1.

The detail of the dataset is quite remarkable, as it allows the authors to test
displacement effects on individuals. However, it may be subject to a few sources
of bias, namely: scraped data from housing-transactions and rental websites may
overestimate housing costs; the link between housing prices and rents need not
be linear, and so it is not clear how accurate the imputations of rents are;
and, the methodology used in 1) matching names to property records and 2)
matching names to races may be subject to all sorts of biases and omissions.
Additionally, the structural spatial equilibrium model is subject to the same
critiques of spatial equilibrium models in general outlined in chapter 2.

My most major critique, and where I feel that this essay contributes the most to
the literature, is that this study may have serious problems with external
validity. It is based on a single case study centered on a single housing type
in a single city. Moreover, the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act was passed by
California ballot initiative in 1995, one year after the change in housing
regulations that the authors use as the source of exogenous variation in their
study. This act established two things that radically undermined California rent
control and almost assuredly affected their results: 1) the Act allowed for
vacancy decontrol, which provides strong incentives for landlords to evict
tneants when the gap between market and controlled rents becomes sufficiently
large, and 2) the Act exempted condominiums and new construction from rent
control. It is not clear how much two of the authors' main findings (that rent
control led to higher eviction rates of lower-income tenants, and that landlords
converted some of their stock of rental housing to condominiums in response to
rent control) were influenced by the law. The aim of this essay is to draw more
general and, hopefully, well-identified conclusions about the impacts of rent
control.

@sims2007 and @autor2014 both study the effects of the end of rent control in
Massachusetts, as part of the wave of state-level anti-rent control legislature
that swept much of the country during the 90s. In particular, they look at the
effect of the passage of Question 9 by Massachusetts ballot referendum in 1994,
which banned any rent control in Massachusetts cities. At the time of the law's
enactment, only the cities of Boston, Cambridge, and Brookline still had rent
control laws on the books^[Note here again the question of political scale. The
anti-rent control advocates consistently failed in opposing the laws at the
local level, where tenants formed a sizable political bloc. At the state level,
the coalition becomes much weaker. Question 9 was passed by a margin of 51-49;
the three rent-controlled towns overwhelmingly voted against, while many of the
never-controlled towns voted for.]. After the passage of Question 9, almost all
housing units in the three cities became decontrolled on January 1, 1995.

Sims uses public data from the American Housing Survey to estimate the impact of
the removal of rent control on several housing characteristics, including the
quantity of rental housing, the level of rent and housing costs, unit quality,
and the length of renter tenure. He uses a DID identification strategy to
compare Census zones in the Boston MSA that experienced decontrol to those that
never experienced rent control, using a model with zone and year fixed effects
and controlling for housing unit characteristics.

To test spillover effects of rent decontrol, Sims uses an instrumental variable
strategy that takes a value of 1 if the unit was *in a zone* that was ever under
rent control and zero otherwise. To test indirect spillover effects, the author
constructs several instruments including the interaction of a 2-family house
indicator (which was excluded from rent control), pre-treatment year indicator,
and controlled-zone indicator. In other words, finding the effect of decontrol
on 2-family homes in controlled zones should provide for the identification of
spillover effects, since these units were never under control. The author
similarly constructs IVs for other forms of never-controlled housing.

Sims finds that the end of rent control had little effect on the construction of
new housing. He further found evidence that rent control decreases the available
number of rental units and increases the number of condominiums (i.e., the
amount of rent-control exempt housing). In other words, rent control seemed to
affect the quantity of housing available for rental, but not the total number of
housing units. He also finds insignificant negative effects of rent control on
indicators of physical housing unit condition, but unsurprisingly, significant
increases in rent charged after decontrol. Finally, he finds that rent
controlled units had much longer tenure times, pointing to the neighborhood
stability effects of rent control.

@autor2014 also examine the effects of the passage of Question 9 in
Massachusetts in the context of spillover effects. The authors were less
interested in specifically quantifying the impacts of rent (de)control, but
instead exploited the exogenous change in regulations to see how residential
externalities get capitalized into housing prices as price regulations were
relaxed. Their identification strategy relies on the fact that both controlled
and never-controlled apartments stood "side-by-side in Cambridge neighborhoods
on the eve of rent control removal thus offering a tight temporal and geographic
framework for assessing the impact of the law on residential prices. In other
words, since the features of rent-controlled apartments (non-owner-occupied
houses, condominiums, or apartments built prior to 1969) were distributed
essentially randomly throughout the Cambridge housing stock, the effects of
purely the exogenous variation in control status can be identified neatly^[Note
here a possible source of exogeneity: age of the housing stock is likely not
random, and in fact is likely to be 1) spatially correlated [@glaeser2014a], and
2) NPV of the housing stock, itself affected by rent-controlled status, is
   dependent on the age of the structure. I return to this point later.].

The authors identified two major channels through which rent decontrol may have
affected the market values of residential properties. The authors term the first
the "direct effect," reflecting the ability of landlords to now charge
market-rate rents; this both increases the maximum rent the landlord may charge
and the net present value of the property. In the framework established in the
first chapter, this is closer to the idea of monopoly rents, or DRII. The second
channel they identify is the indirect effect, where decontrol raises the value
of surrounding, never-controlled properties. The mechanism that the authors
propose is that decontrol inventivizes landlords to "renovate and modernize
decontrolled units, raising their rental values." This attracts higher-income
tenants, which attracts *other* high-income tenants to the *never-controlled*
properties, by means of "improved housing stock and more affluent neighbors."
Read critically, this seems a bit difficult to parse; it is difficult to imagine
that higher-income tenants will be drawn to never-controlled properties due to
better amenities in the formerly-controlled house *next door*. The more
plausible claim is that higher-income tenants will be drawn to never-controlled
units by "better" neighbors in formerly-controlled ones. Given Boston's troubled
history with desegregation, it is not difficult to imagine that "better"
tenants, in this case, probably refer to "whiter" ones [@rothstein2018].

### Critical Questions

Given the paucity of empirical studies on rent control, there are several
interesting questions to be asked here. The ones that this essay will focus
mainly upon are:

A.  **How does rent control impact the supply of housing?** -- Most of the the
    theoretical and empirical work regarding rent controls, such that it exists,
    aims to answer this question. How much does rent control impact the expansion
    of the supply of housing? How does the *type* of housing, as well as its
    condition, change? What are its effects on land values and rental rates?
    Aside from the very recent literature, outlined above, focusing on good
    causal identification, most of the empirical literature assumes that rent
    controls form *ex nihilo* and function as a brake on housing supply growth.
    However, it is quite plausible that the direction of causation runs in the
    opposite direction-- the implementation of rent control by a particular
    electorate might be a *response* to growth in rents and evictions, caused by
    one of the factors identified in the previous chapters.

B. **What is the direction of causation?** -- Do rent controls cause rents to
increase, or do increasing rents cause the imposition of rent controls?
@diamond2018 found that implementing rent control in San Francisco seemed to
cause rents to rise in the long run, but @autor2014 and @sims2007 found that
the
*removal* of rent control in Boston *also* led caused rents and land prices to
increase. Aside from the possibility I explore in the Chapter 2 of a
de-linking of rents and housing supply, is it that rent control *causes*
rents to rise, or is it that cities experiencing high rent growth tend to
enact rent control legislation? This relationship need not be linear either--
it could be that further rises in land value shift the needle in the other
direction due to the relatively increasing payoff to a political coalition of
landowners, as in the abolition of Massachusetts rent control in
1995^[interestingly enough, this is the same year that California passed the
Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act. These also corresponded to the beginning of
the asset bubble that crashed in 2008, and coincided with an apparent
nationwide shift in the balance of power away from tenants and towards
landlords.].
These will hereafter be referred to as *Question A* and *Question B*. In
answering questions A and B, I take direct inspiration from the recent
minimum wage debates in the empirical labor literature. I wish to compare
growth in rents and the housing supply in a particular treatment group vs.
those in a well-defined control group. The details of the selection of each
group will be discussed further in the Methodology section.

## Data

The first step in this investigation is to choose the appropriate scale. Diamond
et. al, Autor et. al, and Sims all relied on single-city case studies focused
around a single change in the rent control law. In the case of Diamond et. al's
study, the source of exogenous variation was a very narrow change that brought a
section of the housing stock under new rent control, which was followed almost
immediately afterwards by a broader, statewide change in the law that had
attenuating effects on the phenomena under consideration. In all three
questions, the narrowness of focus draws questions about external validity. This
essay attempts to bypass those questions by narrowing the scope and broadening
the scale of the study. As such, the first necessary piece of data is a database
of all municipal rent control laws in the country, their date of enactment,
their date of expiration (if any), and the existence of any vacancy decontrol
provisions. Since legislation is a matter of public record, this database should
only require a bit of legwork to construct.

The second set of data I require is a panel data set of (ideally) individual
housing units, their date of construction, whether they are owned or rented,
rent charged, and household size. Granular data at the level of the household
would allow for a ready quasi-experiment with city, year, and household-level
fixed effects.

However, such granular individual data on rents and occupancy are quite
difficult to come by. The few studies that have done so have relied on
proprietary data from data-mining companies (e.g. Diamond et. al) or on
restricted-use versions of U.S. Census data [@desmond2019a] that provide
household-level samples. In absence of such data, I will opt to use a
difference-in-difference approach at a higher geographic level, using Census
surveys that provide data on housing (the American Community Survey and the
American Housing Survey). The goal with this strategy will be to provide
geographies that are plausibly similar in characteristics such as housing
demand, income and income growth, etc. where a subset of these are subject to
the treatment effect (in this case, rent control). This approach presents some
difficulties, however; rent controls are enacted at the local level, while the
smallest local-federal consistent geographic level is the *county*. In other
words, analysis at the tract level would result in many tracts being split at
the city border, while analysis at the *county* level inhibits identification
by including both controlled and non-controlled areas. @sims2007 takes this
approach, by using geographic levels that are not congruent with political
boundaries, and in the absence of granular data, I will follow this approach as
well. More details on the specific methodology are provided in the appropriate
section.

### US Rental Housing Finance Survey

The RHFS is the only recent, nationally representative survey of property
owners. The survey was conducted in 2012 and 2015. It uses a stratified
random-selection procedure to conduct its sample. The first two strata
created were: 1) all large cities (with more than 100,000 housing units)
and 2) a random selection of smaller cities and rural areas. Second, four
other strata were created: properties with 1) 2-4 units, 2) 5-24 units, 3)
25-49 units, and 3) over 50 units. Multiunit rental property addresses
were identified from the Census Master Address File and randomly selected
from each of the eight strata. This procedure produced a representative
survey of multifamily rental properties across the United States. The
restricted version of the dataset is geocoded to provide locations for
each building used in the sample. The RHFS excluded prefabricated homes,
mobile homes, public housing, and single-unit rental properties. This last
element, which includes condominiums, may pose a bias risk as mentioned
above.

The RHFS asked a battery of questions about housing finance,
property values, expenses, and revenue, including: mortgages, landlord
expenses (including property taxes, insurance payments, utilities,
property management fees, maintenance, security, and repairs), potential
rent revenues, and actual rent revenues. The survey bases property values
on property owners' responses, which could introduce bias if landlords
systematically over- or under-value their properties. This bias can be
avoided by using publicly available data on property values. Finally, using this
dataset provides a limitation on the rent control policies that can be
evaluated; the RHFS was conducted three times, in 2012, 2015, and 2018. This
means that this strategy can only be employed for cities that enacted the policy
within that time period.

### American Housing Survey

The American Housing Survey (AHS) is a sample survey of cities across the
United States. The survey is at the level of the housing unit. The AHS
provides data on housing unit characteristics such as rent, maintenance, and
physical condition. Due to privacy concerns, the smallest available
geographic level is the zone. A zone is defined in the AHS codebook as
follows:

>Zone codes are only available in the metropolitan files.  A zone is defined for
>the AHS only as a socio-economically homogeneous area of more than 100,000
>people.  It does not necessarily correspond to a geographic subdivision,
>although in almost all cases each identified zone is equivalent to a group of
>Census tracts.  A zone may follow the boundaries of a county or cover a portion
>of a county.  It may also cover several counties or townships or portion of
>several counties.  The areas in a zone are not always adjacent.  The limited
>sample size in each zone precludes reliable analysis of any single zone

Thus, following @sims2007, I will use the zone as the basis of the analysis,
and the empirical question will become the effects of being in a
rent-controlled zone vs being in a non rent-controlled zone.

## Methodology

To explore the effects of rent control on various housing and neighborhood
characteristics, I will employ the *difference-in-differences* empirical
strategy. This requires a panel data set of repeated observations over time. The
regressor of interest is a variable that varies at the group or aggregate level
over time given a treatment; in this case, whether or not the housing unit was
subject to rent control (if at the household level) or if units in the
geographic area were subject to rent control (if at a higher level of
aggregation). This was the approach used by @diamond2018, where a change in rent
control laws to suddenly incorporate multi-family housing units of a certain age
under the law was used as a quasi-random treatment effect. This is the empirical
strategy I will follow if the restricted-use national data from the RHFS becomes
available in a reasonable amount of time.

If not, then I will instead follow an approach similar to @sims2007, which used
zone-level fixed effects.

The logic behind this approach is relatively straightforward. My goal is to
compare zones in which rent control is enacted to zones that can plausibly be
considered as part of the same rental market that were never controlled
during that interval. Since a metropolitan area consists of many such zones,
some of which fell under rent control and some of which did not, this
approach can be considered as a type of generalized case study approach
(following @dube2010) evaluating the impacts of rent controls in each
metropolitan area. 

$$ y_{ijy} =  \delta_{jy} + \alpha_{jy} + \beta_t T_{ijy} + \epsilon_{iy}, $$

for the metropolitan-level DD specification where, for zone $j$ in
metropolitan area $i$, and year $y$, $y_{iy}$ is a vector of the outcome
variables [total housing stock, total rental units, median rent, length of
rental tenure], $\alpha$ is metropolitan-area fixed effects, $\delta$ is
housing unit fixed effects, and $\epsilon$ is year fixed effects. T_{ijy} is
a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if the zone was subject to rent
control during year *y* and 0 otherwise.The null hypothesis is that the presence
of rent controls do not have a significantly different effect on the outcome
variables in $y_{ijy} in the treatment group vs. the control group. The
alternative hypothesis is that
