title: Three Essays on Urban Economics
author: Osman Keshawarz
toc: true
bibliography: [prospectus.bib]
abstract: This prospectus poses three questions in the field of urban political economy. The first is a theoretical question on the relationship between urban growth, density, wages, profits, and rents, based on classical political economy treatments of the land question. The second is a historical-descriptive question that attempts to apply the theoretical insights of the first chapter to the recent burst of growth and subsequent crisis of housing in San Francisco, California. The final question is an empirical study on the impacts of rent control laws in the United States.

# Introduction: Centering Space in Political Economy

This dissertation proposal describes three dissertation essays that focus on
urban growth, distribution, rents, and housing policy in the United States.
The overall motivation of this dissertation, in the broadest terms, is to
understand how markets for land and housing (and their associated rents)
under capitalist urbanism affect economic outcomes for those living and working
in cities. Over the course of interrogating this question, this dissertation
will touch upon questions of income and wealth inequality, agglomeration
economies, growth theory, and housing policy.

The discipline of Economics has, at long last, been going through something
of its own "spatial turn" in recent years. Looking at growth and welfare across
different states, regions, cities, and even zip codes, recent research has found
striking amounts of heterogeneity and divergence with respect to economic
outcomes. Research like @ganong2017 has looked at the causes of income
divergence between metropolitan regions in the United States. @chetty2014 looks
at the variance in inter-generational economic mobility between commuting zones.
The "New Economic Geography" literature begun by Paul Krugman^["New" in the
sense of new to economics-- Paul Krugman regularly presented his work on NEG at
geography conferences, garnering a markedly lukewarm reception.]

I say that this is a recent turn because questions of space and place have
typically been relegated to peripheral questions in economics proper.

In the body of this dissertation prospectus, I will outline my plan for further
research. In the first essay, I will develop a theoretical framework based on
classical formulations of the land and housing questions to investigate the
relationship between urban growth, land rents, and wages. I will begin by
developing the concept of urban space as theorized by the radical geography
tradition and relating it to the classical political economy though surrounding
land and land rents, beginning with Adam Smith. I intend to demonstrate the ways
in which the urban (productive) capitalist sector interact with workers and
landlords in order to produce a given spatial structure, spatial hierarchy, and
income distribution. This will consist of both a review of the history of
economic thought on land rents and a theoretical argument regarding the role of
urban growth on rents and wages.

In the next essay, I intend to apply the theoretical framework developed in the
first essay to the case of urban growth in San Francisco. The city has several
features that make it an interesting case study. First, it has rapidly
transitioned to the type of urban economy that I propose drive many of the
effects discussed in the previous section-- namely, one with a primary sector
characterized by large agglomeration economies. Second, the city's (and the
state of California's generally) political economy is influenced by a relatively
powerful political class of landlords and developers. Third, the city exhibits
physical limits to sprawl (in the form of the Pacific Ocean) and also varying
levels of political constraints to expansion by the aforementioned landowning
class. Thus, it is a useful case study to explore the way distributional
conflict occurs across urban space. The essay will take a historical approach,
outlining in broad strokes the evolution of land prices, wages and rents since
WWII, and examining in particular detail the most recent period of expansion
since 2012 and its associated housing crisis. The essay will rely on descriptive
data on wages, profits, rents, housing construction,  evictions provided by the
Census Bureau, HUD, and the City of San Francisco, archival data on housing
developments and public construction, and data on housing and rents scraped from
the Internet.

The final essay is an empirical investigation into one of the policies that
municipalities may use to control rent growth and hence alter the
distribution of income: rent control. Though the consensus of economists is
tilted heavily against rent control as an appropriate mechanism for the
promotion of housing affordability, empirical evidence for the proposed
negative effects of rent control has been mixed. This essay, then, represents
a contribution to the somewhat scant empirical literature on rent control in
the United States. Using either restricted-use data from the Census Bureau's
Rental Housing Finance survey or publicly available data on housing from the
American Community Survey, this essay uses a quasi-experimental research
design that designates either households qualifying for rent control or
municipalities enacting rent control as the treatment group and compares them
to a geographically-adjacent control region that did not enact rent control,
following @dube2010. This essay is intended to causally identify the impacts of
rent control on the housing supply, rental supply, and neighborhood stability.

# What do Landlords Do? The Political Economy of Urban Growth and Distribution

## Abstract

This chapter is about urban growth. Who wins when a city grows? Who benefits
from economies of scale and economies of agglomeration? In particular, how is
the distribution of urban economic growth affected by the distribution of and
control over land (and housing)? How are these distributional decisions made
and implemented? In this essay, I present a theoretical account of the way
that cities grow, and the way that this growth is divided between wages,
profits, and rents. The particularly urban features of agglomeration feature
heavily into this account. I begin with the observation that neoclassical
treatments of urban growth have, since John Bates Clark, left out land as a
particular factor of production. Without accounting for the role of
landlords, any account of the role of rents in urban growth (which is likely
to quite large) will likely be insufficient. I follow this with a
presentation of the classical political economy thought on land rents and
growth, followed by a formal presentation of a broadly Marxian-Georgist
account of growth and distribution in an urban economy.

## Research Questions

1. To what extent are gains from public goods and productivity increases
   captured by landlords?

2. How do the peculiarities of urban growth (agglomeration, long-lived
   structures) affect the distributions of wages, profits and rents?

3. What is the relationship between wages, profits, and rents in an urban
   economy? What are the structural features of this relationship, and what
   drives their variation across cities?

This essay is motivated by a deceptively simple question: When cities expand,
do rents rise or do they fall? The simple Economics 101 answer is that of
course, when more space is brought into the urban system (by, e.g., expanding
the supply of housing through either new construction or upzoning existing
neighborhoods for greater density), then rents should *ceteris paribus* fall.
Yet, in descriptive sense, this is not quite what we have seen happen; in
cities with comparatively high levels of productivity, we have seen slowdowns
in housing construction (this is true for the United States generally) and
large increases in housing costs and property values.

As mentioned in the introduction to this proposal, questions regarding land
and land rents were central to the questions of economics for centuries prior
to the marginal revolution, before being relegated to the comparatively small
subfields of Urban and Real Estate Economics. In recent years, the
recognition of geographic inequalities across and within cities and regions
have brought attention back to the role that geographic space, in the
somewhat truncated forms of "distance" and "place." Meanwhile, the fields of
Geography, Urban Planning, and Sociology, among others, continued to grapple
with the issues of land rents and spatial structure and hierarchy in the
interregnum, most notably in the radical urban geography tradition begun by
Lefebvre and the discipline of urban sociology pioneered at the University of
Chicago.

This essay is an attempt to engage some of the insights of classical economic
thought on land and land-rents in answering modern economic questions of
growth and distribution. I intend to incorporate some of the contributions of
radical geography, particularly notions of *space*, *spatiality,* and
*spatial hierarchies.* It is important to note here that I will largely be
talking about *land*, which is only a subset of *spatial relations* that
comprise urban geographies. It is also important to note here that although
much of the discussion in this chapter will center around housing costs in
the form of residential rents, the focus of this chapter is on land rents and
land ownership more generally, rather than on the particular problem of high
housing costs. This last feature is an important element of my critique of
some of the modern theoretical literature on urban growth, which I expand upon
further in that respective section.

The essay will be structured as follows: First, I discuss the role of land rents
and urban structure in classical accounts of growth and distribution, paying
particular attention to Karl Marx and Henry George. The essential focus here
will be to adapt the classical thought on rents and landlords to questions
surrounding the dynamics of modern urban land and housing prices (essentially:
how do urban agglomerative effects interact with rents?). After that, I will
develop these into a formal theoretical presentation.

## Literature Review: Capitalist Urbanism, Capitalists on Urbanism

# On Growth and Housing in San Francisco

## Research Questions

1. What are the structural features of the historical periods of expansion in
   San Francisco during the Post-WWII Era?

2. How did these economic expansions show up in the distribution of wages, profits, and rents?

3. From the perspective of growth in rents and the housing crisis, is the most
   recent period different of expansion different than previous eras? If so,
   what are the features driving the difference?

## Abstract

This chapter applies the theoretical insights from the previous chapter into a
historical-discriptive account of the growth and development of the city of San
Francisco. In many ways, it is a story about the structural transformation of
the technology economy, and how its rapid growth affected the demographic and
incomes of the population on the one hand, and housing costs and urban structure
on the other hand.

# Rent Control Revisited: Is it Good, Actually?

1. To what extent is new housing construction affected by the implementation of
   rent controls?

2. To what extent is the supply of *rental housing* affected by the
   implementation of rent controls?

3. To what extent do rent controls accomplish the goals of maintaining housing
   affordability and neighborhood stability?

## Abstract

This essay is a contribution to the empirical literature on rent control in
the United States. Despite re-invigorated demands for rent control policies
globally, the consensus of the economics discipline has remained solidly
against the measure. Most of this opposition is on theoretical grounds,
rather than empirical evidence. How severe are the deleterious effects of
rent control on the housing supply, rents, and neighborhood composition? Does
it really achieve the desired goal of neighborhood stabilization, or does it
merely increase the rate of gentrification and housing cost growth? This essay
addresses the difficulty of well-identified empirical work on housing in
general, and estimates the impacts of municipal rent control policies on rents,
tenure lengths, neighborhood amenity access, the rate of new housing
construction, and the supply of rental housing.

## Introduction

Rent control is considered as solved a problem as any in economics, with the
consensus of the vast majority of the economics discipline being that the policy
is a textbook case of unintended consequences. Rent control is, of course a
price control, and the consensus view is that it results in social waste, lower
housing quality, housing shortages, and paradoxically higher rents. Despite
this, in the face of spiralling housing costs in many of the metro areas of the
USA, many state and local governments are calling for (and enacting) rent
control regulation.

Similar to academic consensus on the minimum wage debates prior to the 1990s
empirical labor literature, the negative view of economists on rent control
is widespread despite empirical evidence being mixed, at best-- much of the
existing literature struggles with external validity and limited-scope
problems. This chapter serves as in empirical intervention into the rent
control debate. Taking a cue from the minimum wage literature, this paper
intends to estimate the comparative impacts of rent control policies on the
variables of interest-- namely, growth in the housing stock, growth in the
supply of rental housing, home prices, rents, and neighborhood stability. In
addition, following the literature on public goods, this essay seeks to
examine the second-order benefits that rent control may provide by providing
access to the institutions and amenities that promote inter-generational
mobility to those households that would have otherwise been displaced by rising
housing costs.

## Literature Review

@diamond2018 provides the most recent well-identified empirical analysis of rent
control, and is the most similar in methodology and substance to this essay.
They use private data sets from DataQuick and Infutor. The combined datasets
allowed the authors to link the identity of any resident of San Francisco to a
particular address during the period 1990-2016, in order to distinguish between
owner-occupied and rental housing. They combine this with zipcode-level
estimates on rents, imputed from housing price transaction data. In essence,
they estimate a linear relationship between median rents in a zipcode and the
sale price of housing in that zip code. They use this combined dataset to
estimate tenant, landlord, and parcel-level effects of a ballot initiative that
suddenly brought a significant number of multi-family dwellings under the rent
control law. They also estimate welfare effects in a general equilibrium
framework using a structural spatial equilibrium model of the type detailed in
section 2.1.
