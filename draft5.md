title: Three Essays on Urban Economics
author: Osman Keshawarz
toc: true
bibliography: [prospectus.bib]
abstract: This prospectus poses three questions in the field of urban political economy. The first is a theoretical question on the relationship between urban growth, density, wages, profits, and rents, based on classical political economy treatments of the land question. The second is a historical-descriptive question that attempts to apply the theoretical insights of the first chapter to the recent burst of growth and subsequent crisis of housing in San Francisco, California. The final question is an empirical study on the impacts of rent control laws in the United States.

# Introduction: Centering Space in Political Economy

The discipline of Economics has, at long last, been going through something
of its own "spatial turn" in recent years. Looking at growth and welfare across
different states, regions, cities, and even zip codes, recent research has found
striking amounts of heterogeneity and divergence with respect to economic
outcomes. Research like @ganong2017 has looked at the causes of income
divergence between metropolitan regions in the United States. @chetty2014 looks
at the variance in inter-generational economic mobility between commuting zones.

I say that this is a recent turn because questions of space and place have
typically been relegated to peripheral questions in economics proper.

# What do Landlords Do? The Political Economy of Urban Growth and Distribution

## Abstract

This chapter is about urban growth. Who wins when a city grows? Who benefits
from economies of scale and economies of agglomeration? In particular, how is
the distribution of urban economic growth affected by the distribution of and
control over land and housing? How are these distributional decisions made
and implemented? In this essay, I present a theoretical account of the way
that cities grow, and the way that this growth is divided between wages,
profits, and rents. The particularly urban features of agglomeration feature
heavily into this account. I begin with the observation that neoclassical
treatments of urban growth have, since John Bates Clark, left out land as a
particular factor of production. Without accounting for the role of
landlords, any account of the role of rents in urban growth (which is likely
to quite large) will likely be insufficient. I follow this with a
presentation of the classical political-economic thought on land rents and
growth, followed by a formal presentation of a broadly Marxian-Georgist
account of growth and distribution in an urban economy.

## Research Questions

1. To what extent are gains from public goods and productivity increases
   captured by landlords?

2. How do the peculiarities of urban growth (agglomeration, long-lived
   structures) affect the distributions of wages, profits and rents? 

3. What is the relationship between wages, profits, and rents in an urban
   economy? What are the structural features of this relationship, and what
   drives their variation across cities? 

## Introduction

This essay is motivated by a deceptively simple question: When cities expand,
do rents rise or do they fall? The simple Economics 101 answer is that of
course, when more space is brought into the urban system (by, e.g., expanding
the supply of housing through either new construction or upzoning existing
neighborhoods for greater density), then rents should *ceteris paribus* fall.
Yet, in descriptive sense, this is not quite what we have seen happen; in
cities with comparatively high levels of productivity, we have seen slowdowns
in housing construction (this is true for the United States generally) and
large increases in housing costs and property values.

As mentioned in the introduction to this proposal, questions regarding land and
land rents were central to the questions of economics for centuries prior to the
marginal revolution, before being relegated to the comparatively small subfields
of Urban and Real Estate Economics. In recent years, the recognition of
geographic inequalities across and within cities and regions have brought
attention back to the role that geographic space, in the somewhat truncated
forms of "distance" and "place." 

Meanwhile, the fields of Geography, Urban Planning, and Sociology, among others,
continued to grapple with the issues of land rents and spatial structure and
hierarchy in the interregnum, most notably in the radical urban geography
tradition begun by Lefebvre and the discipline of urban sociology pioneered at
the University of Chicago. 

This essay is an attempt to engage some of the insights of classical economic
thought on land and land-rents in answering modern economic questions of
growth and distribution. I intend to incorporate some of the contributions of
radical geography, particularly notions of *space*, *spatiality,* and
*spatial hierarchies.* It is important to note here that I will largely be
talking about *land*, which is only a subset of *spatial relations* that
comprise urban geographies. It is also important to note here that although
much of the discussion in this chapter will center around housing costs in
the form of residential rents, the focus of this chapter is on land rents and
land ownership more generally, rather than on the particular problem of high
housing costs. This last feature is an important element of my critique of
some of the modern theoretical literature on urban growth, which I expand upon
further in that respective section.

The essay will be structured as follows: First, I discuss the role of land rents
and urban structure in classical accounts of growth and distribution, paying
particular attention to Karl Marx and Henry George. The essential focus here
will be to adapt the classical thought on rents and landlords to questions
surrounding the dynamics of modern urban land and housing prices (essentially:
how do urban agglomerative effects interact with rents?). After that, I will
develop these into a formal theoretical presentation.



# On Growth and Housing in San Francisco

## Abstract

This chapter applies the theoretical insights from the previous chapter into a
historical-discriptive account of the growth and development of the city of San
Francisco. In many ways, it is a story about the structural transformation of
the technology economy, and how its rapid growth affected the demographic and
incomes of the population on the one hand, and housing costs and urban structure
on the other hand.

# Rent Control Revisited: Is it Good, Actually? 

## Abstract

This essay is a contribution to the empirical literature on rent control in
the United States. Despite re-invigorated demands for rent control policies
globally, the consensus of the economics discipline has remained solidly
against the measure. Most of this opposition is on theoretical grounds,
rather than empirical evidence. How severe are the deleterious effects of
rent control on the housing supply, rents, and neighborhood composition? Does
it really achieve the desired goal of neighborhood stabilization, or does it
merely increase the rate of gentrification and housing cost growth? This essay
addresses the difficulty of well-identified empirical work on housing in
general, and estimates the impacts of municipal rent control policies on rents,
tenure lengths, neighborhood amenity access, the rate of new housing
construction, and the supply of rental housing.
