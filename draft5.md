abstract: This prospectus poses three questions in the field of urban political economy. The first is a theoretical question on the relationship between urban growth, density, wages, profits, and rents, based on classical political economy treatments of the land question. The second is a historical-descriptive question that attempts to apply the theoretical insights of the first chapter to the recent burst of growth and subsequent crisis of housing in San Francisco, California. The final question is an empirical study on the impacts of rent control laws in the United States.

# Introduction: Centering Space in Political Economy

The world is urban. 

*talk a bit more about lefebvre and urban relations here.*
*also, talk about the different problems in which land and geography*
*show up. A brief intro to land and space.*

The urban revolution dreamt of by Lefebvre is, for the most part, well under
way. This is true in a literal sense, as the global *physical* urban population
rises dramatically, but more to the geographer's point-- urban social relations
have become generalized. 

This prospectus outlines a proposal for three essays on the themes of urban
growth, distribution, rents, and housing policy in the United States. The
overall motivation of this dissertation, in the broadest terms, is to
understand how markets for land and housing (and their associated rents)
under capitalist urbanism affect economic outcomes for those living and
working in cities. Over the course of evaluating this question, this
dissertation will touch upon questions of income and wealth inequality,
agglomeration economies, growth theory, and housing policy.

The discipline of Economics has, at long last, been going through something
of its own "spatial turn" in recent years. Looking at growth and welfare
across different states, regions, cities, and even zip codes, recent research
has found striking amounts of heterogeneity and divergence with respect to
economic outcomes. It has become clear that questions of space and geography
have are becoming more and more central to the basic questions of economics. 
Research like @ganong2017 has looked at the causes of income divergence
between metropolitan regions in the United States. @chetty2014 looks at the
variance in inter-generational economic mobility between commuting zones. The
"New Economic Geography" literature begun by Paul Krugman^["New" in the sense
of new to economics-- Paul Krugman regularly presented his work on NEG at
geography conferences, garnering a markedly lukewarm reception.] in the 1980s
represented an early attempt to bring questions of space into economic theory by
way of models adapted from international trade theory.

The rapid shift in the spatial awareness, so to speak, of economics, has become
such that @proost2019, very firmly in the neoclassical camp, begin themselves to
sound like the radical geographers: 

> Space is the substratum of human affairs, but  it  is  also  a  consumption
> and  production  good  in  the  form  of  land.  The  worldwide  supply of
> land is perfectly inelastic but vastly exceeds  the  demand  for  it.
> Therefore,  putting  aside  the  agricultural  land  rent,  the  price  of
> land  should  be  zero.  Yet,  housing  costs may be very high and vary
> enormously with  the  size  and  composition  of  cities  for  reasons  that
> do  not  depend  on  the  quality  of  the  housing  structure. 

It is precisely this relationship, between the geographic unevenness of the
scale of human activity (i.e., the agglomeration of cities), the price of land
and its associated necessity for any human activity, including production of
commodities and the re-production of the labor force, that this dissertation
will investigate. In the body of this prospectus, I will outline my plan for
further research on the role of land and rents in urban economics. In the
first essay, I will develop a theoretical framework based on classical
formulations of the land and housing questions to investigate the
relationship between urban growth, land rents, and wages. I will begin by
developing the concept of urban space as theorized by the radical geography
tradition and relating it to the classical political economy thought
surrounding land and land rents, beginning with Adam Smith. I intend to
demonstrate the ways in which the urban (productive) capitalist sector
interact with workers and landlords in order to produce a given spatial
structure, spatial hierarchy, and income distribution. This will consist of
both a review of the history of economic thought on land rents and a
theoretical argument regarding the role of urban growth on rents and wages.
*What is urban capitalism, as Lefebvre defines it? How does this make the
concept spatiality have meaning? What does it mean for control over land?
Finally, how do I bring this back into economics proper?*

In the next essay, I intend to apply the theoretical framework developed in the
first essay to the case of urban growth in San Francisco. The city has several
features that make it an interesting case study. First, it has rapidly
transitioned to the type of urban economy that I propose drive many of the
effects discussed in the previous section-- namely, one with a primary sector
characterized by large agglomeration economies. Second, the city's (and the
state of California's generally) political economy is influenced by a relatively
powerful political class of landlords and developers. Third, the city exhibits
physical limits to sprawl (in the form of the Pacific Ocean) and also varying
levels of political constraints to expansion by the aforementioned landowning
class. Thus, it is a useful case study to explore the way distributional
conflict occurs across urban space. The essay will take a historical approach,
outlining in broad strokes the evolution of land prices, wages and rents since
WWII, and examining in particular detail the most recent period of expansion
since 2012 and its associated housing crisis. The essay will rely on descriptive
data on wages, profits, rents, housing construction,  evictions provided by the
Census Bureau, HUD, and the City of San Francisco, archival data on housing
developments and public construction, and data on housing and rents scraped from
the Internet.

The final essay is an empirical investigation into one of the policies that
municipalities may use to control rent growth and hence alter the
distribution of income: rent control. Though the consensus of economists is
tilted heavily against rent control as an appropriate mechanism for the
promotion of housing affordability, empirical evidence for the proposed
negative effects of rent control has been mixed. This essay, then, represents
a contribution to the somewhat scant empirical literature on rent control in
the United States. Using either restricted-use data from the Census Bureau's
Rental Housing Finance survey or publicly available data on housing from the
American Community Survey, this essay uses a quasi-experimental research
design that designates either households qualifying for rent control or
municipalities enacting rent control as the treatment group and compares them
to a geographically-adjacent control region that did not enact rent control,
following @dube2010. This essay is intended to causally identify the impacts of
rent control on the housing supply, rental supply, and neighborhood stability.
This essay is intended to provide more evidence on the debate over the
appropriate policy to take in order to maintain housing affordability in U.S.
cities. 

Taken together, these three essays represent a contribution to the
understanding the function of landownership and land rents in influencing the
distribution of incomes in advanced economies generally, with implications
for the study of income and wealth inequality, spatial patterns of growth and
decline, and housing and urban policy.

# What do Landlords Do? The Political Economy of Urban Growth and Distribution

## Abstract

This chapter is about urban growth. Who wins when a city grows? Who benefits
from economies of scale and economies of agglomeration? In particular, how is
the distribution of urban economic growth affected by the distribution of and
control over land (and housing)? How are these distributional decisions made
and implemented? In this essay, I present a theoretical account of the way
that cities grow, and the way that this growth is divided between wages,
profits, and rents. The particularly urban features of agglomeration feature
heavily into this account. I begin with the observation that neoclassical
treatments of urban growth have, since John Bates Clark, left out land as a
particular factor of production. Without accounting for the role of
landlords, any account of the role of rents in urban growth (which is likely
to quite large) will likely be insufficient. I follow this with a
presentation of the classical political economy thought on land rents and
growth, followed by a formal presentation of a broadly Marxian-Georgist
account of growth and distribution in an urban economy.

## Research Questions

1. To what extent are gains from public goods and productivity increases
   captured by landlords?

2. How do the peculiarities of urban growth (agglomeration, long-lived
   structures) affect the distributions of wages, profits and rents?

3. What is the relationship between wages, profits, and rents in an urban
   economy? What are the structural features of this relationship, and what
   drives their variation across cities?

This essay is motivated by a deceptively simple question: When cities expand,
do rents rise or do they fall? The simple Economics 101 answer is that of
course, when more space is brought into the urban system (by, e.g., expanding
the supply of housing through either new construction or upzoning existing
neighborhoods for greater density), then rents should *ceteris paribus* fall.

Much of the recent urban economics literature has focused on particularly the
relationship of the housing sector to urban growth.  

*This is a good place for a discussion on Glaeser, Gyourko, Hsieh & Moretti, in
the context of Regulationist and supply-side explanations for urban growth
constraints*

Of course, *ceteris* is never *paribus*, and the most confounding feature comes
from the nature of cities themselves: they are an increasing-returns phenomenon,
and the expansion of a city itself may be a function of the desirability and
productivity of that city. In other words, when a city grows, the expansion of
the housing supply may not result in a decrease in rents. 

Let us pursue this line a bit further. I ask here another deceptively simple
question: why do we live in cities in the first place? Why not simply live in
relatively undifferentiated gradations of density and transportation networks
that sprawl over the available area? This question, at the root of the fields of
urban economics, sociology, geography, planning, and many others, still remains
elusive. Especially so in economics, as the (somewhat dated, but still quite
relevant) quote at the beginning of this introduction suggests.  

As mentioned in the introduction to this proposal, questions regarding land
and land rents were central to the questions of economics for centuries prior
to the marginal revolution, before being relegated to the comparatively small
subfields of Urban and Real Estate Economics. In recent years, the
recognition of geographic inequalities across and within cities and regions
have brought attention back to the role that geographic space, in the
somewhat truncated forms of "distance" and "place." Meanwhile, the fields of
Geography, Urban Planning, and Sociology, among others, continued to grapple
with the issues of land rents and spatial structure and hierarchy in the
interregnum, most notably in the radical urban geography tradition begun by
Lefebvre and the discipline of urban sociology pioneered at the University of
Chicago.

This essay is an attempt to engage some of the insights of classical economic
thought on land and land-rents in answering modern economic questions of
growth and distribution. I intend to incorporate some of the contributions of
radical geography, particularly notions of *space*, *spatiality,* and
*spatial hierarchies.* It is important to note here that I will largely be
talking about *land*, which is only a subset of *spatial relations* that
comprise urban geographies. It is also important to note here that although
much of the discussion in this chapter will center around housing costs in
the form of residential rents, the focus of this chapter is on land rents and
land ownership more generally, rather than on the particular problem of high
housing costs. This last feature is an important element of my critique of
some of the modern theoretical literature on urban growth, which I expand upon
further in that respective section.

The essay will be structured as follows: First, I discuss the role of land rents
and urban structure in classical accounts of growth and distribution, paying
particular attention to Karl Marx and Henry George. The essential focus here
will be to adapt the classical thought on rents and landlords to questions
surrounding the dynamics of modern urban land and housing prices (essentially:
how do urban agglomerative effects interact with rents?). After that, I will
develop these into a formal theoretical presentation.


## Literature Review: Capitalist Urbanism, Capitalists on Urbanism

# On Growth and Housing in San Francisco

## Research Questions

1. What are the structural features of the historical periods of expansion in
   San Francisco during the Post-WWII Era?

2. How did these economic expansions show up in the distribution of wages, profits, and rents?

3. From the perspective of growth in rents and the housing crisis, is the most
   recent period different of expansion different than previous eras? If so,
   what are the features driving the difference?

## Abstract

This chapter applies the theoretical insights from the previous chapter into a
historical-discriptive account of the growth and development of the city of San
Francisco. In many ways, it is a story about the structural transformation of
the technology economy, and how its rapid growth affected the demographic and
incomes of the population on the one hand, and housing costs and urban structure
on the other hand.

# Rent Control Revisited: Is it Good, Actually?

1. To what extent is new housing construction affected by the implementation of
   rent controls?

2. To what extent is the supply of *rental housing* affected by the
   implementation of rent controls?

3. To what extent do rent controls accomplish the goals of maintaining housing
   affordability and neighborhood stability?

## Abstract

This essay is a contribution to the empirical literature on rent control in
the United States. Despite re-invigorated demands for rent control policies
globally, the consensus of the economics discipline has remained solidly
against the measure. Most of this opposition is on theoretical grounds,
rather than empirical evidence. How severe are the deleterious effects of
rent control on the housing supply, rents, and neighborhood composition? Does
it really achieve the desired goal of neighborhood stabilization, or does it
merely increase the rate of gentrification and housing cost growth? This essay
addresses the difficulty of well-identified empirical work on housing in
general, and estimates the impacts of municipal rent control policies on rents,
tenure lengths, neighborhood amenity access, the rate of new housing
construction, and the supply of rental housing.

## Introduction

Rent control is considered as solved a problem as any in economics, with the
consensus of the vast majority of the economics discipline being that the policy
is a textbook case of unintended consequences. Rent control is, of course a
price control, and the consensus view is that it results in social waste, lower
housing quality, housing shortages, and paradoxically higher rents. Despite
this, in the face of spiralling housing costs in many of the metro areas of the
USA, many state and local governments are calling for (and enacting) rent
control regulation.

Similar to academic consensus on the minimum wage debates prior to the 1990s
empirical labor literature, the negative view of economists on rent control
is widespread despite empirical evidence being mixed, at best-- much of the
existing literature struggles with external validity and limited-scope
problems. This chapter serves as in empirical intervention into the rent
control debate. Taking a cue from the minimum wage literature, this paper
intends to estimate the comparative impacts of rent control policies on the
variables of interest-- namely, growth in the housing stock, growth in the
supply of rental housing, home prices, rents, and neighborhood stability. In
addition, following the literature on public goods, this essay seeks to
examine the second-order benefits that rent control may provide by providing
access to the institutions and amenities that promote inter-generational
mobility to those households that would have otherwise been displaced by rising
housing costs.

## Literature Review

@diamond2018 provides the most recent well-identified empirical analysis of rent
control, and is the most similar in methodology and substance to this essay.
They use private data sets from DataQuick and Infutor. The combined datasets
allowed the authors to link the identity of any resident of San Francisco to a
particular address during the period 1990-2016, in order to distinguish between
owner-occupied and rental housing. They combine this with zipcode-level
estimates on rents, imputed from housing price transaction data. In essence,
they estimate a linear relationship between median rents in a zipcode and the
sale price of housing in that zip code. They use this combined dataset to
estimate tenant, landlord, and parcel-level effects of a ballot initiative that
suddenly brought a significant number of multi-family dwellings under the rent
control law. They also estimate welfare effects in a general equilibrium
framework using a structural spatial equilibrium model of the type detailed in
section 2.1.

The detail of the dataset is quite remarkable, as it allows the authors to test
displacement effects on individuals. However, it may be subject to a few sources
of bias, namely: scraped data from housing-transactions and rental websites may
overestimate housing costs; the link between housing prices and rents need not
be linear, and so it is not clear how accurate the imputations of rents are;
and, the methodology used in 1) matching names to property records and 2)
matching names to races may be subject to all sorts of biases and omissions.
Additionally, the structural spatial equilibrium model is subject to the same
critiques of spatial equilibrium models in general outlined in chapter 2. 

My most major critique, and where I feel that this essay contributes the most to
the literature, is that this study may have serious problems with external
validity. It is based on a single case study centered on a single housing type
in a single city. Moreover, the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act was passed by
California ballot initiative in 1995, one year after the change in housing
regulations that the authors use as the source of exogenous variation in their
study. This act established two things that radically undermined California rent
control and almost assuredly affected their results: 1) the Act allowed for
vacancy decontrol, which provides strong incentives for landlords to evict
tneants when the gap between market and controlled rents becomes sufficiently
large, and 2) the Act exempted condominiums and new construction from rent
control. It is not clear how much two of the authors' main findings (that rent
control led to higher eviction rates of lower-income tenants, and that landlords
converted some of their stock of rental housing to condominiums in response to
rent control) were influenced by the law. The aim of this essay is to draw more
general and, hopefully, well-identified conclusions about the impacts of rent
control.

@sims2007 and @autor2014 both study the effects of the end of rent control in
Massachusetts, as part of the wave of state-level anti-rent control legislature
that swept much of the country during the 90s. In particular, they look at the
effect of the passage of Question 9 by Massachusetts ballot referendum in 1994,
which banned any rent control in Massachusetts cities. At the time of the law's
enactment, only the cities of Boston, Cambridge, and Brookline still had rent
control laws on the books^[Note here again the question of political scale. The
anti-rent control advocates consistently failed in opposing the laws at the
local level, where tenants formed a sizable political bloc. At the state level,
the coalition becomes much weaker. Question 9 was passed by a margin of 51-49;
the three rent-controlled towns overwhelmingly voted against, while many of the
never-controlled towns voted for.]. After the passage of Question 9, almost all
housing units in the three cities became decontrolled on January 1, 1995. 

Sims uses public data from the American Housing Survey to estimate the impact of
the removal of rent control on several housing characteristics, including the
quantity of rental housing, the level of rent and housing costs, unit quality,
and the length of renter tenure. He uses a DID identification strategy to
compare Census zones in the Boston MSA that experienced decontrol to those that
never experienced rent control, using a model with zone and year fixed effects
and controlling for housing unit characteristics. 

To test spillover effects of rent decontrol, Sims uses an instrumental variable
strategy that takes a value of 1 if the unit was *in a zone* that was ever under
rent control and zero otherwise. To test indirect spillover effects, the author
constructs several instruments including the interaction of a 2-family house
indicator (which was excluded from rent control), pre-treatment year indicator,
and controlled-zone indicator. In other words, finding the effect of decontrol
on 2-family homes in controlled zones should provide for the identification of
spillover effects, since these units were never under control. The author
similarly constructs IVs for other forms of never-controlled housing. 

Sims finds that the end of rent control had little effect on the construction of
new housing. He further found evidence that rent control decreases the available
number of rental units and increases the number of condominiums (i.e., the
amount of rent-control exempt housing). In other words, rent control seemed to
affect the quantity of housing available for rental, but not the total number of
housing units. He also finds insignificant negative effects of rent control on
indicators of physical housing unit condition, but unsurprisingly, significant
increases in rent charged after decontrol. Finally, he finds that rent
controlled units had much longer tenure times, pointing to the neighborhood
stability effects of rent control. 

@autor2014 also examine the effects of the passage of Question 9 in
Massachusetts in the context of spillover effects. The authors were less
interested in specifically quantifying the impacts of rent (de)control, but
instead exploited the exogenous change in regulations to see how residential
externalities get capitalized into housing prices as price regulations were
relaxed. Their identification strategy relies on the fact that both controlled
and never-controlled apartments stood "side-by-side in Cambridge neighborhoods
on the eve of rent control removal thus offering a tight temporal and geographic
framework for assessing the impact of the law on residential prices. In other
words, since the features of rent-controlled apartments (non-owner0occupied
houses, condominiums, or apartments built prior to 1969) were distributed
essentially randomly throughout the Cambridge housing stock, the effects of
purely the exogenous variation in control status can be identified neatly^[Note
here a possible source of exogeneity: age of the housing stock is likely not
random, and in fact is likely to be 1) spatially correlated [@glaeser2014a], and
2) NPV of the housing stock, itself affected by rent-controlled status, is
   dependent on the age of the structure. I return to this point later.]. 

The authors identified two major channels through which rent decontrol may have
affected the market values of residential properties. The authors term the first
the "direct effect," reflecting the ability of landlords to now charge
market-rate rents; this both increases the maximum rent the landlord may charge
and the net present value of the property. In the framework established in the
first chapter, this is closer to the idea of monopoly rents, or DRII. The second
channel they identify is the indirect effect, where decontrol raises the value
of surrounding, never-controlled properties. The mechanism that the authors
propose is that decontrol inventivizes landlords to "renovate and modernize
decontrolled units, raising their rental values." This attracts higher-income
tenants, which attracts *other* high-income tenants to the *never-controlled*
properties, by means of "improved housing stock and more affluent neighbors."
Read critically, this seems a bit difficult to parse; it is difficult to imagine
that higher-income tenants will be drawn to never-controlled properties due to
better amenities in the formerly-controlled house *next door*. The more
plausible claim is that higher-income tenants will be drawn to never-controlled
units by "better" neighbors in formerly-controlled ones. Given Boston's troubled
history with desegregation, it is not difficult to imagine that "better"
tenants, in this case, probably refer to "whiter" ones [@rothstein2018].

### Critical Questions

Given the paucity of empirical studies on rent control, there are several
interesting questions to be asked here. The ones that this essay will focus
mainly upon are:

A.  **How does rent control impact the supply of housing?** -- Most of the the
    theoretical and empirical work regarding rent controls, such that it exists,
    aims to answer this question. How much does rent control impact the expansion
    of the supply of housing? How does the *type* of housing, as well as its
    condition, change? What are its effects on land values and rental rates?
    Aside from the very recent literature, outlined above, focusing on good
    causal identification, most of the empirical literature assumes that rent
    controls form *ex nihilo* and function as a brake on housing supply growth.
    However, it is quite plausible that the direction of causation runs in the
    opposite direction-- the implementation of rent control by a particular
    electorate might be a *response* to growth in rents and evictions, caused by
    one of the factors identified in the previous chapters. 

B.  **What is the direction of causation?** -- Do rent controls cause rents to
    increase, or do increasing rents cause the imposition of rent controls?
    @diamond2018 found that implementing rent control in San Francisco seemed to
    cause rents to rise in the long run, but @autor2014 and @sims2007 found that the
    *removal* of rent control in Boston *also* led caused rents and land prices to
    increase. Aside from the possibility I explore in the Chapter 2 of a de-linking
    of rents and housing supply, is it that rent control *causes* rents to rise, or
    is it that cities experiencing high rent growth tend to enact rent control
    legislation? This relationship need not be linear either-- it could be that
    further rises in land value shift the needle in the other direction due to the
    relatively increasing payoff to a political coalition of landowners, as in the
    abolition of Massachusetts rent control in 1995^[interestingly enough, this is
    the same year that California passed the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act. These
    also corresponded to the beginning of the asset bubble that crashed in 2008, and
    coincided with an apparent nationwide shift in the balance of power away from
    tenants and towards landlords.].

C.  **To what extent does rent control impact neighborhood stability and access**
    **to public goods?** -- Aside from questions of housing supply and efficiency,
    the empirical literature is in relative agreement on the role of rent
    control in allowing tenants to remain in their homes^[except in cases with
    vacancy decontrol, which incentivizes landlords to evict]. Aside from
    utility directly obtained from not being evicted (and correspondingly for
    the landlord, having a long-term, stable tenant), it might be the case that
    in the face of highly place-based amenities and mobility effects (e.g.
    @chetty2014), rent control may allow access to public amenities (e.g. public
    schools) that allow for higher intergenerational mobility. For example--
    does living in a reng-controlled neighborhood preserve access to
    institutions that allow for mobility among those who would otherwise be
    trapped in low-mobility environments? This type of question would be, in
    principle, rather difficult to answer, as it requires determining where a
    particular resident would be displaced to if the area were not rent
    controlled. In a descriptive way, this essay can look at migrations and
    evictions that occured as a result of blanket rent control bans by state
    governments. 

These will hereafter be referred to as *Question A*, *Question B*, and *Question
C*. In answering questions A and B, I take direct inspiration from the recent
minimum wage debates in the empirical labor literature. I wish to compare growth
in rents and the housing supply in a particular treatment group vs. those in a
well-defined control group. The details of the selection of each group will be
discussed further in the Methodology section.

## Data

The first step in this investigation is to choose the appropriate scale. Diamond
et. al, Autor et. al, and Sims all relied on single-city case studies focused
around a single change in the rent control law. In the case of Diamond et. al's
study, the source of exogenous variation was a very narrow change that brought a
section of the housing stock under new rent control, which was followed almost
immediately afterwards by a broader, statewide change in the law that had
attenuating effects on the phenomena under consideration. In all three
questions, the narrowness of focus draws questions about external validity. This
essay attempts to bypass those questions by narrowing the scope and broadening
the scale of the study. As such, the first necessary piece of data is a database
of all municipal rent control laws in the country, their date of enactment,
their date of expiration (if any), and the existence of any vacancy decontrol
provisions. Since legislation is a matter of public record, this database should
only require a bit of legwork to construct. 

The second set of data I require is a panel data set of (ideally) individual
housing units, their date of construction, whether they are owned or rented,
rent charged, and household size. Granular data at the level of the household
would allow for a ready quasi-experiment with city, year, and household-level
fixed effects.

However, such granular individual data on rents and occupancy are quite
difficult to come by. The few studies that have done so have relied on
proprietary data from data-mining companies (e.g. Diamond et. al) or on
restricted-use versions of U.S. Census data [@desmond2019a] that provide
household-level samples. In absence of such data, I will opt to use a
difference-in-difference approach at a higher geographic level, using Census
surveys that provide data on housing (the American Community Survey and the
American Housing Survey). The goal with this strategy will be to provide
geographies that are plausibly similar in characteristics such as housing
demand, income and income growth, etc. where a subset of these are subject to
the treatment effect (in this case, rent control). This approach presents some
difficulties, however; rent controls are enacted at the local level, while the
smallest local-federal consistent geographic level is the *county*. In other
words, analysis at the tract level would result in many tracts being split at
the city border, while analysis at the *county* level inhibits identification
by including both controlled and non-controlled areas. @sims2007 takes this
approach, by using geographic levels that are not congruent with political
boundaries, and in the absence of granular data, I will follow this approach as
well. More details on the specific methodology are provided in the appropriate
section. 

### US Rental Housing Finance Survey

The RHFS is the only recent, nationally representative survey of property
owners. The survey was conducted in 2012 and 2015. It uses a stratified
random-selection procedure to conduct its sample. The first two strata
created were: 1) all large cities (with more than 100,000 housing units)
and 2) a random selection of smaller cities and rural areas. Second, four
other strata were created: properties with 1) 2-4 units, 2) 5-24 units, 3)
25-49 units, and 3) over 50 units. Multiunit rental property addresses
were identified from the Census Master Address File and randomly selected
from each of the eight strata. This procedure produced a representative
survey of multifamily rental properties across the United States. The
restricted version of the dataset is geocoded to provide locations for
each building used in the sample. The RHFS excluded prefabricated homes,
mobile homes, public housing, and single-unit rental properties. This last
element, which includes condominiums, may pose a bias risk as mentioned
above.

The RHFS asked a battery of questions about housing finance,
property values, expenses, and revenue, including: mortgages, landlord
expenses (including property taxes, insurance payments, utilities,
property management fees, maintenance, security, and repairs), potential
rent revenues, and actual rent revenues. The survey bases property values
on property owners' responses, which could introduce bias if landlords
systematically over- or under-value their properties. This bias can be
avoided by using publicly available data on property values. Finally, using this
dataset provides a limitation on the rent control policies that can be
evaluated; the RHFS was conducted three times, in 2012, 2015, and 2018. This
means that this strategy can only be employed for cities that enacted the policy
within that time period. 

### American Housing Survey

## Methodology

To explore the effects of rent control on various housing and neighborhood
characteristics, I will employ the *difference-in-differences* empirical
strategy. This requires a panel data set of repeated observations over time. The
regressor of interest is a variable that varies at the group or aggregate level
over time given a treatment; in this case, whether or not the housing unit was
subject to rent control (if at the household level) or if units in the
geographic area were subject to rent control (if at a higher level of
aggregation). This was the approach used by @diamond2018, where a change in rent
control laws to suddenly incorporate multi-family housing units of a certain age
under the law was used as a quasi-random treatment effect. This is the empirical
strategy I will follow if the restricted-use national data from the RHFS becomes
available in a reasonable amount of time. 

If not, then I will instead follow an approach similar to @sims2007, which used
the smallest geographic level available in the AHS; the zone. A zone is defined
in the AHS codebook as follows: 

>Zone codes are only available in the metropolitan files.  A zone is defined for
>the AHS only as a socio-economically homogeneous area of more than 100,000
>people.  It does not necessarily correspond to a geographic subdivision,
>although in almost all cases each identified zone is equivalent to a group of
>Census tracts.  A zone may follow the boundaries of a county or cover a portion
>of a county.  It may also cover several counties or townships or portion of
>several counties.  The areas in a zone are not always adjacent.  The limited
>sample size in each zone precludes reliable analysis of any single zone  

My goal is to compare zones in which rent control is enacted to zones that
can plausibly be considered as part of the same rental market that were never
controlled during that interval. Following @dube2010, I will take the
approach of using contiguous zones with the assumption that employment and
housing markets do not vary widely between zones. The cross-border effects of
rent-control are not well-understood yet, so this may be a possible source of
bias. The benefit to using the AHS data is that the Public Use Microdata are
available going back several decades, making it possible to test many more
implementations of the policy over time. The drawback is that any controlled
zone is likely to be bordered by several uncontrolled zones, meaning that
control sample is much larger than the treatment sample, introducing a greater
possibility of ommitted variable variation bias. It might be possible to rectify
this using a higher geographic level of aggregation (i.e., using county
subdivisions or counties). The problem here is that the higher level of
aggregation makes the assumption of similar land, housing, and labor markets
much less plausible. 

### Question A

To answer Question A, I want to estimate equations of the general form 

$$ y_{iy} = \alpha_{jy} + \delta_{i} + \beta_t T_{i} + \epsilon\_{iy} $$

if the RHFS data become available, or 

$$ y_{jy} = \alpha_{jy} + \beta_t T_{j} + \epsilon\_{iy}, $$

for the contiguous-zone DD specification where, for household $i$, zone $j$,
and year $y$, $y_{iy}$ is a vector of the outcome variables [total housing
stock, total rental units, median rent, length of rental tenure], $\alpha$ is
county/city fixed effects, and $\delta$ is housing unit fixed effects.
