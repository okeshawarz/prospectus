title: Three Essays on Urban Economics
author: Osman Keshawarz
toc: true
bibliography: [prospectus.bib]
abstract: This prospectus poses three questions in the field of urban political economy. The first is a theoretical question on the relationship between urban growth, density, wages, profits, and rents, based on classical political economy treatments of the land question. The second is a historical-descriptive question that attempts to apply the theoretical insights of the first chapter to the recent burst of growth and subsequent crisis of housing in San Francisco, California. The final question is an empirical study on the impacts of rent control laws in the United States.

# Introduction: Centering Space in Political Economy

The discipline of Economics has, at long last, been going through something
of its own "spatial turn" in recent years. Looking at growth and welfare across
different states, regions, cities, and even zip codes, recent research has found
striking amounts of heterogeneity and divergence with respect to economic
outcomes. Research like @ganong2017 has looked at the causes of income
divergence between metropolitan regions in the United States. @chetty2014 looks
at the variance in intergenerational economic mobility between commuting zones. 

I say that this is a recent turn because questions of space and place have
typically been relegated to peripheral questions in economics proper.

# What do Landlords Do? The Political Economy of Urban Growth and Distribution

## Abstract

This chapter is about urban growth. Who wins when a city grows? Who benefits
from economies of scale and economies of agglomeration? In particular, how is
the distribution of urban economic growth affected by the distribution of and
control over land and housing? How are these distributional decisions made? In
this essay, I present a theoretical account of the way that cities grow, and the
way that this growth is divided between wages, profits, and rents. The
particularly urban features of agglomeration feature heavily into this account.
I begin with the observation that neoclassical treatments of urban growth have,
since John Bates Clark, left out land as a particular factor of production.
Without accounting for the role of landlords, any account of the role of rents
in urban growth (which is likely to quite large) will likely be insufficient. I
follow this with a presentation of the classical political-economic thought on
land rents and growth, followed by a formal presentation of a broadly
Marxian-Georgist account of growth and distribution in an urban economy subject
to large agglomeration economies. 

# On Growth and Housing in San Francisco

## Abstract

This chapter applies the theoretical insights from the previous chapter into a
historical-discriptive account of the growth and development of the city of San
Francisco. In many ways, it is a story about the structural transformation of
the technology economy, and how its rapid growth affected the demographic and
incomes of the population on the one hand, and housing costs and urban structure
on the other hand.

# Rent Control Revisited: Is it Good, Actually? 

## Abstract

This essay is a contribution to the empirical literature on rent control in
the United States. Despite re-invigorated demands for rent control policies
globally, the consensus of the economics discipline has remained solidly
against the measure. Most of this opposition is on theoretical grounds,
rather than empirical evidence. How severe are the deleterious effects of
rent control on the housing supply, rents, and neighborhood composition? Does
it really achieve the desired goal of neighborhood stabilization, or does it
merely increase the rate of gentrification and housing cost growth? This essay
addresses the difficulty of well-identified empirical work on housing in
general, and estimates the impacts of municipal rent control policies on rents,
tenure lengths, neighborhood amenity access, the rate of new housing
construction, and the supply of rental housing.
