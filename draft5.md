title: Three Essays on Urban Economics
author: Osman Keshawarz
toc: true
bibliography: [prospectus.bib]
abstract: This prospectus poses three questions in the field of urban political economy. The first is a theoretical question on the relationship between urban growth, density, wages, profits, and rents, based on classical political economy treatments of the land question. The second is a historical-descriptive question that attempts to apply the theoretical insights of the first chapter to the recent burst of growth and subsequent crisis of housing in San Francisco, California. The final question is an empirical study on the impacts of rent control laws in the United States.

# Introduction: Centering Space in Political Economy

The discipline of Economics has, at long last, been going through something
of its own "spatial turn" in recent years. Looking at growth and welfare across
different states, regions, cities, and even zip codes, recent research has found
striking amounts of heterogeneity and divergence with respect to economic
outcomes. Research like @ganong2017 has looked at the causes of income
divergence between metropolitan regions in the United States. @chetty2014 looks
at the variance in inter-generational economic mobility between commuting zones.

I say that this is a recent turn because questions of space and place have
typically been relegated to peripheral questions in economics proper.

# What do Landlords Do? The Political Economy of Urban Growth and Distribution

## Abstract

This chapter is about urban growth. Who wins when a city grows? Who benefits
from economies of scale and economies of agglomeration? In particular, how is
the distribution of urban economic growth affected by the distribution of and
control over land and housing? How are these distributional decisions made?
In this essay, I present a theoretical account of the way that cities grow,
and the way that this growth is divided between wages, profits, and rents.
The particularly urban features of agglomeration feature heavily into this
account. I begin with the observation that neoclassical treatments of urban
growth have, since John Bates Clark, left out land as a particular factor of
production. Without accounting for the role of landlords, any account of the
role of rents in urban growth (which is likely to quite large) will likely be
insufficient. I follow this with a presentation of the classical
political-economic thought on land rents and growth, followed by a formal
presentation of a broadly Marxian account of urban growth and distribution.

## Introduction

This essay is motivated by a deceptively simple question: When cities expand, do
rents rise or do they fall? The simple Economics 101 answer is that of course,
when more space is brought into the urban system (by, e.g., expanding the supply
of housing through either new construction or upzoning existing neighborhoods
for greater density),

# On Growth and Housing in San Francisco

## Abstract

This chapter applies the theoretical insights from the previous chapter into a
historical-discriptive account of the growth and development of the city of San
Francisco. In many ways, it is a story about the structural transformation of
the technology economy, and how its rapid growth affected the demographic and
incomes of the population on the one hand, and housing costs and urban structure
on the other hand.

# Rent Control Revisited: Is it Good, Actually?

## Abstract

This essay is a contribution to the empirical literature on rent control in
the United States. Despite re-invigorated demands for rent control policies
globally, the consensus of the economics discipline has remained solidly
against the measure. Most of this opposition is on theoretical grounds,
rather than empirical evidence. How severe are the deleterious effects of
rent control on the housing supply, rents, and neighborhood composition? Does
it really achieve the desired goal of neighborhood stabilization, or does it
merely increase the rate of gentrification and housing cost growth? This essay
addresses the difficulty of well-identified empirical work on housing in
general, and estimates the impacts of municipal rent control policies on rents,
tenure lengths, neighborhood amenity access, the rate of new housing
construction, and the supply of rental housing.

## Introduction

Rent control is considered as solved a problem as any in economics, with the
consensus of the vast majority of the economics discipline being that the policy
is a textbook case of unintended consequences. Rent control is, of course a
price control, and the consensus view is that it results in social waste, lower
housing quality, housing shortages, and paradoxically higher rents. Despite
this, in the face of spiralling housing costs in many of the metro areas of the
USA, many state and local governments are calling for (and enacting) rent
control regulation.

Similar to academic consensus on the minimum wage debates prior to the 1990s
empirical labor literature, the negative view of economists on rent control
is widespread despite empirical evidence being mixed, at best-- much of the
existing literature struggles with external validity and limited-scope
problems. This chapter serves as in empirical intervention into the rent
control debate. Taking a cue from the minimum wage literature, this paper
intends to estimate the comparative impacts of rent control policies on the
variables of interest-- namely, growth in the housing stock, growth in the
supply of rental housing, home prices, rents, and neighborhood stability. In
addition, following the literature on public goods, this essay seeks to
examine the second-order benefits that rent control may provide by providing
access to the institutions and amenities that promote inter-generational
mobility to those households that would have otherwise been displaced by rising
housing costs.

## Literature Review

@diamond2018 provides the most recent well-identified empirical analysis of rent
control, and is the most similar in methodology and substance to this essay.
They use private data sets from DataQuick and Infutor. The combined datasets
allowed the authors to link the identity of any resident of San Francisco to a
particular address during the period 1990-2016, in order to distinguish between
owner-occupied and rental housing. They combine this with zipcode-level
estimates on rents, imputed from housing price transaction data. In essence,
they estimate a linear relationship between median rents in a zipcode and the
sale price of housing in that zip code. They use this combined dataset to
estimate tenant, landlord, and parcel-level effects of a ballot initiative that
suddenly brought a significant number of multi-family dwellings under the rent
control law. They also estimate welfare effects in a general equilibrium
framework using a structural spatial equilibrium model of the type detailed in
section 2.1.
