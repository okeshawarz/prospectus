## Engels - The Condition of the Working Class in England

[@engels1872]

# Is Rent Control is Good, Actually?

## Diamond et. al - "The Effects of Rent Control Expansion on..."

[@diamond2018] investigate the impacts of the expansion of rent control in the San Francisco housing market. 

## Freemark

**@freemark2019:** Freemark investigates the impact of changes in allowed zoning density ("upzoning") on residential real estate sale prices and construction permits. The author relies on two exogenous changes in regulations in Chicago, one in 2013 and the other in 2015; these zoning changes were city-wide and eliminate a source of endogeneity in "planned" zoning changes (e.g., upzoning in a particular parcel due to an increase in demand in a particular neighborhood).
