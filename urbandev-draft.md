title: Real Estate and Class Power in the United States
author: Osman Keshawarz
abstract: This paper focuses on the role of the real estate sector in generating inequality in the United States. I first evaluate the affordability crisis occurring in the U.S. housing market, along with mainstream explanations of the crisis. I show that these explanations of the crisis fall short, and offer an alternative explanation based on the class dynamics of Karl Marx and Henry George.
